= Add a custom TLS certificate
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

You can remove the existing self-signed TLS certificate and replace it with a TLS certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).

.What you'll need

* Kubernetes cluster with Astra Control Center installed
* Administrative access to a command shell on the cluster to run `kubectl` commands
* Private key and certificate files from the CA

== Remove the self-signed certificate

Remove the existing self-signed TLS certificate.

. Using SSH, log in to the Kubernetes cluster that hosts Astra Control Center as an administrative user.
. Find the TLS secret associated with the current certificate using the following command, replacing `<ACC-deployment-namespace>` with the Astra Control Center deployment namespace:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get certificate -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
----
. Delete the currently installed secret and certificate using the following commands:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl delete cert cert-manager-certificates -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
kubectl delete secret secure-testing-cert -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
----

== Add a new certificate

Add a new TLS certificate that is signed by a CA.

. Use the following command to create the new TLS secret with the private key and certificate files from the CA, replacing the arguments in brackets <> with the appropriate information:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl create secret tls <secret-name> --key <private-key-filename> --cert <certificate-filename> -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
----
. Use the following command and example to edit the cluster Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file and change the `spec.selfSigned` value to `spec.ca.secretName` to refer to the TLS secret you created earlier:
+
----
kubectl edit clusterissuers.cert-manager.io/cert-manager-certificates -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
....

#spec:
#  selfSigned: {}

spec:
  ca:
    secretName: <secret-name>
----
. Use the following command and example output to validate that the changes are correct and the cluster is ready to validate certificates, replacing `<ACC-deployment-namespace>` with the Astra Control Center deployment namespace:
+
----
kubectl describe clusterissuers.cert-manager.io/cert-manager-certificates -n <ACC-deployment-namespace>
....

----
. Create the certificate using the following command:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml

. Using a web browser, browse to the deployment IP address of Astra Control Center.
. Verify that the certificate details match the details of the certificate you installed.
. Export the certificate and import the result into the certificate manager in your web browser.
