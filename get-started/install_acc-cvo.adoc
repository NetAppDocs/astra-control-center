NOTE: Ensure that the operating environment you choose to host Astra Control Center meets the basic resource requirements outlined in the environment's official documentation.

Astra Control Center requires the following resources in addition to the environment's resource requirements:


[cols=2*,options="header",cols="1h,2a"]
|===
| Component
| Requirement
| Backend NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage capacity | At least 300GB available
| Worker nodes (AWS EC2 requirement) | At least 3 worker nodes total, with 4 vCPU cores and 12GB RAM each
| Load balancer | Service type "LoadBalancer" available for ingress traffic to be sent to services in the operational environment cluster
| FQDN | A method for pointing the FQDN of Astra Control Center to the load balanced IP address
| Astra Trident (installed as part of the Kubernetes cluster discovery in NetApp BlueXP, formerly Cloud Manager) | Astra Trident 21.04 or newer installed and configured and NetApp ONTAP version 9.5 or newer as a storage backend
| Image registry | You must have an existing private registry, such as AWS Elastic Container Registry, to which you can push Astra Control Center build images. You need to provide the URL of the image registry where you will upload the images.

NOTE: The Astra Control Center hosted cluster and the managed cluster must have access to the same image registry to be able to back up and restore apps using the Restic-based image.

| Astra Trident / ONTAP configuration | Astra Control Center requires that a storage class be created and set as the default storage class. Astra Control Center supports the following ONTAP Kubernetes storage classes that are created when you import your Kubernetes cluster into NetApp BlueXP (formerly Cloud Manager). These are provided by Astra Trident:

* `vsaworkingenvironment-<>-ha-nas               csi.trident.netapp.io`
* `vsaworkingenvironment-<>-ha-san               csi.trident.netapp.io`
* `vsaworkingenvironment-<>-single-nas           csi.trident.netapp.io`
* `vsaworkingenvironment-<>-single-san           csi.trident.netapp.io`
|
|===

NOTE: These requirements assume that Astra Control Center is the only application running in the operational environment. If the environment is running additional applications, adjust these minimum requirements accordingly.

NOTE: The AWS registry token expires in 12 hours, after which you will have to renew the Docker image registry secret.


=== Overview of deployment for AWS
Here is an overview of the process to install Astra Control Center for AWS with Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a storage backend.

Each of these steps is explained in more detail below.

. <<Ensure that you have sufficient IAM permissions>>.
. <<Install a RedHat OpenShift cluster on AWS>>.
. <<Configure AWS>>.
. <<Configure NetApp BlueXP for AWS>>.
. <<Install Astra Control Center for AWS>>.


=== Ensure that you have sufficient IAM permissions
Ensure that you have sufficient IAM roles and permissions that enable you to install a RedHat OpenShift cluster and a NetApp BlueXP (formerly Cloud Manager) Connector.

See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-accounts-aws.html#initial-aws-credentials[Initial AWS credentials^].


=== Install a RedHat OpenShift cluster on AWS
Install a RedHat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on AWS.

For installation instructions, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.html[Installing a cluster on AWS in OpenShift Container Platform^].

=== Configure AWS
Next, configure AWS to create a virtual network, set up EC2 compute instances, create an AWS S3 bucket, create an Elastic Container Register (ECR) to host the Astra Control Center images, and push the images to this registry.

Follow the AWS documentation to complete the following steps. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.html[AWS installation documentation^].



. Create an AWS virtual network.
. Review the EC2 compute instances. This can be a bare metal server or VMs in AWS.
. If the instance type does not already match the Astra minimum resource requirements for master and worker nodes, change the instance type in AWS to meet the Astra requirements.  Refer to link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Control Center requirements^].
. Create at least one AWS S3 bucket to store your backups.
. Create an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to host all the ACC images.
+
NOTE: If you do not create the ECR, Astra Control Center cannot access monitoring data from a cluster containing Cloud Volumes ONTAP with an AWS backend. The issue is caused when the cluster you try to discover and manage using Astra Control Center does not have AWS ECR access.

. Push the ACC images to your defined registry.

NOTE: The AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) token expires after 12 hours and causes cross-cluster clone operations to fail. This issue occurs when managing a storage backend from Cloud Volumes ONTAP configured for AWS. To correct this issue, authenticate with the ECR again and generate a new secret for clone operations to resume successfully.

Here's an example of an AWS deployment:
