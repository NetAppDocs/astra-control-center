[.lead]
To install Astra Control Center, download the installation bundle from the NetApp Support Site and perform the following steps. You can use this procedure to install Astra Control Center in internet-connected or air-gapped environments.

.Other installation procedures
[%collapsible]
====
* *Install with RedHat Openshift OperatorHub*: Use this link:../get-started/acc_operatorhub_install.html[alternative procedure] to install Astra Control Center on Openshift using OperatorHub.
* *Install in the public cloud with Cloud Volumes ONTAP backend*: Use link:../get-started/install_acc-cvo.html[these procedures] to install Astra Control Center in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage backend.

For a demonstration of the Astra Control Center installation process, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eurMV80b0Ks&list=PLdXI3bZJEw7mJz13z7YdiGCS6gNQgV_aN&index=5[this video^]. 

.What you'll need
* link:requirements.html[Before you begin installation, prepare your environment for Astra Control Center deployment].
* If you have configured or want to configure pod security policies in your environment, familiarize yourself with pod security policies and how they affect Astra Control Center installation. See link:../concepts/understand-pod-security.html[Understand pod security policy restrictions].
* Ensure all API services are in a healthy state and available:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get apiservices
----

* Ensure the Astra FQDN you plan to use is routable to this cluster. This means that you either have a DNS entry in your internal DNS server or you are using a core URL route that is already registered.
* If a cert manager already exists in the cluster, you need to perform some link:../get-started/cert-manager-prereqs.html[prerequisite steps] so that Astra Control Center does not attempt to install its own cert manager. By default, Astra Control Center installs its own cert manager during installation.

.About this task
The Astra Control Center installation process helps you to do the following:

* Install the Astra components into the `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace.
* Create a default Astra Control Owner admin account.
* Establish an administrative user email address and default initial setup password. This user is assigned the Owner role that is needed for first time login to the UI.
* Determine that all Astra Control Center pods are running.
* Install the Astra Control Center UI.
//VMware ADS EAP review


IMPORTANT: Do not delete the Astra Control Center operator (for example, `kubectl delete -f astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`) at any time during Astra Control Center installation or operation to avoid deleting pods.

.Steps

To install Astra Control Center, do the following steps:

* <<Download and extract Astra Control Center>>

== Install the NetApp Astra kubectl plugin

The NetApp Astra kubectl command line plugin saves time when performing common tasks associated with deploying and upgrading Astra Control Center.

.What you'll need

NetApp provides plugin binaries for different CPU architectures and operating systems. You need to know which CPU and operating system you have before you perform this task.

.Steps

. List the available NetApp Astra kubectl plugin binaries, and note the name of the file you need for your operating system and CPU architecture: 
+
NOTE: The kubectl plugin library is part of the tar bundle and is extracted into the folder `kubectl-astra`.
+
[source,console]
----
ls kubectl-astra/
----
. Move the correct binary into the current path and rename it to `kubectl-astra`:
+
[source,console]
----
cp kubectl-astra/<binary-name> /usr/local/bin/kubectl-astra
----

include::../_include/docker-podman-add-images.adoc[]

== Set up namespace and secret for registries with auth requirements

. Export the KUBECONFIG for the Astra Control Center host cluster:
+
[source,console]
----
export KUBECONFIG=[file path]
----
+
NOTE: Before you complete the installation, be sure your KUBECONFIG is pointing to the cluster where you want to install Astra Control Center. The KUBECONFIG can contain only one context.


.  If you use a registry that requires authentication, you need to do the following:
.. Create the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create ns netapp-acc-operator
----
+
Response:
+
----
namespace/netapp-acc-operator created
----

.. Create a secret for the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace. Add Docker information and run the following command:
+
NOTE: The placeholder `your_registry_path` should match the location of the images that you uploaded earlier (for example, `[Registry_URL]/netapp/astra/astracc/22.11.0-82`).
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry astra-registry-cred -n netapp-acc-operator --docker-server=[your_registry_path] --docker-username=[username] --docker-password=[token]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
secret/astra-registry-cred created
----
+
NOTE: If you delete the namespace after the secret is generated, recreate the namespace and then regenerate the secret for the namespace.

.. Create the `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create ns [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
namespace/netapp-acc created
----

.. Create a secret for the `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace. Add Docker information and run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry astra-registry-cred -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace] --docker-server=[your_registry_path] --docker-username=[username] --docker-password=[token]
----
+
Response
+
----
secret/astra-registry-cred created
----

== Install the Astra Control Center operator

. Change the directory:
+
[source,console]
----
cd manifests
----

. Edit the Astra Control Center operator deployment YAML (`astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`) to refer to your local registry and secret.
+
[source,console]
----
vim astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml
----
+
NOTE: An annotated sample YAML follows these steps.

.. If you use a registry that requires authentication, replace the default line of `imagePullSecrets: []` with the following:
+
[source,console]
----
imagePullSecrets:
- name: astra-registry-cred
----

.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `kube-rbac-proxy` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<Add the images to your local registry,previous step>>.
.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `acc-operator-controller-manager` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<Add the images to your local registry,previous step>>.

*`Generic`* (`ingressType: "Generic"`) (Default)
Use this option when you have another ingress controller in use or would prefer to use your own ingress controller. After Astra Control Center is deployed, you will need to configure the link:../get-started/install_acc.html#set-up-ingress-for-load-balancing[ingress controller^] to expose Astra Control Center with a URL.

*`AccTraefik`* (`ingressType: "AccTraefik"`)
Use this option when you would prefer not to configure an ingress controller. This deploys the Astra Control Center `traefik` gateway as a Kubernetes LoadBalancer type service.

Astra Control Center uses a service of the type "LoadBalancer" (`svc/traefik` in the Astra Control Center namespace), and requires that it be assigned an accessible external IP address. If load balancers are permitted in your environment and you don't already have one configured, you can use MetalLB or another external service load balancer to assign an external IP address to the service. In the internal DNS server configuration, you should point the chosen DNS name for Astra Control Center to the load-balanced IP address.

NOTE: For details about the service type of "LoadBalancer" and ingress, see link:../get-started/requirements.html[Requirements^].

| string

|Setting |Guidance |Type |Options

| `astraResourcesScaler`
| Scaling options for AstraControlCenter Resource limits. By default, Astra Control Center deploys with resource requests set for most of the components within Astra. This configuration allows the Astra Control Center software stack to perform better in environments under increased application load and scale.

However, in scenarios using smaller development or test clusters, the CR field `astraResourcesScalar` may be set to `Off`. This disables resource requests and allows for deployment on smaller clusters.
| string

====
Your selections in this section determine how Astra Control Center should handle CRDs.
|===
|Setting |Guidance |Type |Example

| `crds.externalCertManager`
| If you use an external cert manager, change `externalCertManager` to `true`. The default `false` causes Astra Control Center to install its own cert manager CRDs during installation. 

CRDs are cluster-wide objects and installing them might have an impact on other parts of the cluster. You can use this flag to signal to Astra Control Center that these CRDs will be installed and managed by the cluster administrator outside of Astra Control Center.
| Boolean
| `False` (this value is the default)

| `crds.externalTraefik`
| By default, Astra Control Center will install required Traefik CRDs. CRDs are cluster-wide objects and installing them might have an impact on other parts of the cluster. You can use this flag to signal to Astra Control Center that these CRDs will be installed and managed by the cluster administrator outside of Astra Control Center.

. (Optional) To ensure the installation is completed, you can watch the `acc-operator` logs using the following command.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl logs deploy/acc-operator-controller-manager -n netapp-acc-operator -c manager -f
----
+
NOTE: `accHost` cluster registration is one of the last operations, and if it fails it will not cause deployment to fail. In the event of a cluster registration failure indicated in the logs, you can attempt registration again through the link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[Add cluster workflow in the UI] or API.

. When all the pods are running, verify that the installation was successful (`READY` is `True`) and get the initial setup password you will use when you log in to Astra Control Center:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get AstraControlCenter -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Response:
+
----
NAME    UUID                                  VERSION     ADDRESS         READY
astra   9aa5fdae-4214-4cb7-9976-5d8b4c0ce27f  22.11.0-82  10.111.111.111  True
----
+
IMPORTANT: Copy the UUID value. The password is `ACC-` followed by the UUID value (`ACC-[UUID]` or, in this example, `ACC-9aa5fdae-4214-4cb7-9976-5d8b4c0ce27f`).

== Set up ingress for load balancing

You can set up a Kubernetes ingress controller that manages external access to services. These procedures give setup examples for an ingress controller if you used the default of `ingressType: "Generic"` in the Astra Control Center custom resource (`astra_control_center.yaml`). You do not need to use this procedure if you specified `ingressType: "AccTraefik"` in the Astra Control Center custom resource (`astra_control_center.yaml`).

After Astra Control Center is deployed, you will need to configure the ingress controller to expose Astra Control Center with a URL.

Setup steps differ depending on the type of ingress controller you use. Astra Control Center supports many ingress controller types. These setup procedures provide example steps for the following ingress controller types:

* Istio ingress
* Nginx ingress controller
* OpenShift ingress controller

.What you'll need

* The required https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/[ingress controller] should already be deployed.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class[ingress class] corresponding to the ingress controller should already be created.

.Steps for Istio ingress

. Configure Istio ingress.
+
NOTE: This procedure assumes that Istio is deployed using the "default" configuration profile. 

. Gather or create the desired certificate and private key file for the Ingress Gateway.
+
You can use a CA-signed or self-signed certificate. The common name must be the Astra address (FQDN).
+
Sample command: 
+
[source,console]
----
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt
----

. Create a secret `tls secret name` of type `kubernetes.io/tls` for a TLS private key and certificate in the `istio-system namespace` as described in TLS secrets.
+
Sample command: 
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create secret tls [tls secret name] --key="tls.key" --cert="tls.crt" -n istio-system
----
+
TIP: The name of the secret should match the `spec.tls.secretName` provided in `istio-ingress.yaml` file.


. Deploy an ingress resource in the `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace using the v1 resource type for a schema (`istio-Ingress.yaml` is used in this example):
+
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: istio
spec:
  controller: istio.io/ingress-controller
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
spec:
  ingressClassName: istio
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: [ACC address]
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: traefik
            port:
              number: 80
----

. Apply the changes:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl apply -f istio-Ingress.yaml
----

. Check the status of the ingress:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get ingress -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Response:
+
----
NAME    CLASS HOSTS             ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
ingress istio astra.example.com 172.16.103.248  80, 443 1h
----

. <<Configure Astra Control Center,Finish Astra Control Center installation>>.


.Steps for Nginx ingress controller

. Create a secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` for a TLS private key and certificate in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace as described in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets[TLS secrets].
. Deploy an ingress resource in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace using the v1 resource type for a schema (`nginx-Ingress.yaml` is used in this example):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: netapp-acc-ingress
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
spec:
  ingressClassName: [class name for nginx controller]
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: <ACC address>
    http:
      paths:
        - path:
          backend:
            service:
              name: traefik
              port:
                number: 80
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
----

. Apply the changes:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl apply -f nginx-Ingress.yaml
----

WARNING: NetApp recommends installing the nginx controller as a deployment rather than a `daemonSet`.

.Steps for OpenShift ingress controller

. Procure your certificate and get the key, certificate, and CA files ready for use by the OpenShift route.
. Create the OpenShift route:
+
[source,console]
----
oc create route edge --service=traefik --port=web -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace] --insecure-policy=Redirect --hostname=<ACC address> --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
----


== Log in to the Astra Control Center UI

After installing Astra Control Center, you will change the password for the default administrator and log in to the Astra Control Center UI dashboard.

.Steps
. In a browser, enter the FQDN (including the `https://` prefix) you used in the `astraAddress` in the `astra_control_center.yaml` CR when <<Configure Astra Control Center,you installed Astra Control Center>>.
. Accept the self-signed certificates if prompted.
+
NOTE: You can create a custom certificate after login.

. At the Astra Control Center login page, enter the value you used for `email` in `astra_control_center.yaml` CR when <<Configure Astra Control Center,you installed Astra Control Center>>, followed by the initial setup password (`ACC-[UUID]`).
+
NOTE: If you enter an incorrect password three times, the admin account will be locked for 15 minutes.

. Select *Login*.
. Change the password when prompted.
+
NOTE: If this is your first login and you forget the password and no other administrative user accounts have yet been created, contact https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp Support] for password recovery assistance.

. (Optional) Remove the existing self-signed TLS certificate and replace it with a link:../get-started/add-custom-tls-certificate.html[custom TLS certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA)].

== Troubleshoot the installation

If any of the services are in `Error` status, you can inspect the logs. Look for API response codes in the 400 to 500 range. Those indicate the place where a failure happened.

.Steps

. To inspect the Astra Control Center operator logs, enter the following:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl logs deploy/acc-operator-controller-manager -n netapp-acc-operator -c manager -f
----

== What's next

* (Optional) Depending on your environment, complete post-installation link:configure-after-install.html[configuration steps].
* Complete the deployment by performing link:setup_overview.html[setup tasks].
