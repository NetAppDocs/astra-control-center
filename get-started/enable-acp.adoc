[.lead]
Astra Trident versions 23.10 and later include the option to use Astra Control Provisioner, which enables licensed Astra Control users to access advanced storage provisioning functionality. Astra Control Provisioner provides this extended functionality in addition to standard Astra Trident CSI-based functionality.

In coming Astra Control updates, Astra Control Provisioner will replace Astra Trident as storage provisioner and orchestrator and be mandatory for Astra Control use. Because of this, it's strongly recommended that Astra Control users enable Astra Control Provisioner. Astra Trident will continue to remain open source and be released, maintained, supported, and updated with new CSI and other features from NetApp.

//acp to trident revert
//Summary: Astra Control Provisioner has replaced Astra Trident as storage provisioner and orchestrator and must be enabled for Astra Control use.

//Beginning with Astra Control Center 24.02, you must enable Astra Control Provisioner, which replaces Astra Trident as storage provisioner and orchestrator in the Astra Control architecture, to use Astra Control. Astra Trident versions 23.10 and later include the option to use Astra Control Provisioner, which enables licensed Astra Control users to access advanced storage provisioning functionality. 

.About this task

You should follow this procedure if you are a licensed Astra Control Center user and you are looking to use Astra Control Provisioner functionality. You should also follow this procedure if you are an Astra Trident user and want to use the additional functionality that Astra Control Provisioner provides without also using Astra Control.

For each case, the provisioner functionality is not enabled by default in Astra Trident 24.02 and must be enabled.

.Before you begin

If you are enabling Astra Control Provisioner, do the following first:

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.Astra Control Provisioners users with Astra Control Center

* *Obtain an Astra Control Center license*: You'll need an link:../concepts/licensing.html[Astra Control Center license] to enable Astra Control Provisioner and access the functionality it provides.

* *Install or upgrade to Astra Control Center 23.10 or later*: You'll need the latest Astra Control Center version (24.02) if you are planning to use the latest Astra Control Provisioner functionality (24.02) with Astra Control. 
//** You'll also need the link:../get-started/install_acc.html#install-the-netapp-astra-kubectl-plugin[kubectl plugin] you used during the installation process if you intend to download the Astra Control Provisioner from the NetApp Support Site.

* *Confirm that your cluster has an AMD64 system architecture*: The Astra Control Provisioner image is provided in both AMD64 and ARM64 CPU architectures, but only AMD64 is supported by Astra Control Center.

* *Get an Astra Control Service account for registry access*: If you intend to use the Astra Control registry rather than the NetApp Support Site to download the Astra Control Provisioner image, complete the registration for an https://bluexp.netapp.com/astra-register[Astra Control Service account^]. After you complete and submit the form and create a BlueXP account, you'll receive an Astra Control Service welcome email.

* *If you have Astra Trident installed, confirm that its version is within a four-release window*: You can perform a direct upgrade to Astra Trident 24.02 with Astra Control Provisioner if your Astra Trident is within a four-release window of version 24.02. For example, you can directly upgrade from Astra Trident 23.04 to 24.02.

== (Step 1) Get the Astra Control Provisioner image

Astra Control Center users can get the Astra Control Provisioner image using either the Astra Control registry or NetApp Support Site method. Astra Trident users wanting to use Astra Control Provisioner without Astra Control should use the registry method.

.Astra Control image registry
--

NOTE: You can use Podman instead of Docker for the commands in this procedure. If you are using a Windows environment, PowerShell is recommended.

. Access the NetApp Astra Control image registry:
+
.. Log on to the Astra Control Service web UI and select the figure icon at the top right of the page. 
.. Select *API access*. 
.. Write down your account ID.
.. From the same page, select *Generate API token* and copy the API token string to the clipboard and save it in your editor.
.. Log into the Astra Control registry using your preferred method:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker login cr.astra.netapp.io -u <account-id> -p <api-token>
----
+
[source,crane]
----
crane auth login cr.astra.netapp.io -u <account-id> -p <api-token>
----

. (Custom registries only) Follow these steps to move the image to your custom registry. If you aren't using a registry, follow the Trident operator steps in the link:../get-started/enable-acp.html#step-2-enable-astra-control-provisioner-in-astra-trident[next section].

.. Pull the Astra Control Provisioner image from the registry:
+
NOTE: The image pulled will not support multiple platforms and will only support the same platform as the host that pulled the image, such as Linux AMD64.
+
[source,console]
----
docker pull cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp:24.02.0 --platform <cluster platform>
----
+
Example:
+
----
docker pull cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp:24.02.0 --platform linux/amd64
----

.. Tag the image:
+
[source,console]
----
docker tag cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp:24.02.0 <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0
----

.. Push the image to your custom registry:
+
[source,console]
----
docker push <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0
----

NOTE: You can use Crane copy as an alternative to running these Docker commands:
`crane copy cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp:24.02.0 <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0`

. Download the Astra Control Provisioner bundle (`trident-acp-[version].tar`) from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[Astra Control Center downloads page^].

. (Recommended but optional) Download the certificates and signatures bundle for Astra Control Center (astra-control-center-certs-[version].tar.gz) to verify the signature of the trident-acp-[version] tar bundle.
+
[source,console]
----
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-certs-[version].tar.gz
----
+
[source,console]
----
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify certs/AstraControlCenterDockerImages-public.pub -signature certs/trident-acp-[version].tar.sig trident-acp-[version].tar
----

. Load the Astra Control Provisioner image:
+
[source,console]
----
docker load < trident-acp-24.02.0.tar
----
+
Response:
+
----
Loaded image: trident-acp:24.02.0-linux-amd64

== (Step 2) Enable Astra Control Provisioner in Astra Trident

Determine if the original installation method used an https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#determine-the-original-installation-method[operator (either manually or with Helm) or tridentctl^] and complete the appropriate steps according to your original method.

include::../_include/enable-acp-options-tabbed-block.adoc[]

== Result

Astra Control Provisioner functionality is enabled and you can use any features available for the version you are running.

(For Astra Control Center users only) After Astra Control Provisioner is installed, the cluster hosting the provisioner in the Astra Control Center UI will show an `ACP version` rather than `Trident version` field and current installed version number.
