= Prerequisites for adding a cluster
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

You should ensure that the prerequisite conditions are met before you add a cluster. You should also run the eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center.
//REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.

== What you'll need before you add a cluster
Ensure that your cluster meets the requirements outlined in link:requirements.html#application-cluster-requirements[Application cluster requirements].

////
* One of the following types of clusters:
** Clusters running OpenShift 4.6.8, 4.7, 4.8, or 4.9
** Clusters running Rancher 2.5.8, 2.5.9, or 2.6 with RKE1
** Clusters running Kubernetes 1.20 to 1.23
** Clusters running VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 1.4
** Clusters running VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition 1.12.2
+
Make sure your clusters have one or more worker nodes with at least 1GB RAM available for running telemetry services.
+
////

NOTE: If you plan to add a second OpenShift 4.6, 4.7, or 4.8 cluster as a managed compute resource, you should ensure that the Astra Trident Volume Snapshot feature is enabled. See the official Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[instructions^] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Astra Trident.

* Astra Trident StorageClasses configured with a link:requirements.html#supported-storage-backends[supported storage backend] (required for any type of cluster)
* The superuser and user ID set on the backing ONTAP system to back up and restore apps with Astra Control Center. Run the following command in the ONTAP command line:
`export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name>  -ruleindex 1 -superuser sysm --anon 65534`
* An Astra Trident `volumesnapshotclass` object that has been defined by an administrator. See the Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[instructions^] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Astra Trident.
* Ensure that you have only a single default storage class defined for your Kubernetes cluster.

////
* Clusters running the Docker daemon with logging that supports `json-file`. Enable this as follows:
. SSH into each worker node and edit the Docker configuration by using sudo:
+
`[docker@worker-0 ~]$ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/docker`
. Change the `log-driver` from `journald` to `json-file` so that the options line reads as follows:
+
`OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --log-driver=json-file --signature-verification=false'`
. Restart the Docker daemon:
+
`[docker@worker-0 ~]$ sudo systemctl restart docker`
////

== Run eligibility checks

Run the following eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center.

.Steps

. Check the Trident version.
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get tridentversions -n trident
----
+
If Trident exists, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
NAME      VERSION
trident   21.04.0
----
+
If Trident does not exist, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "tridentversions"
----
+
NOTE: If Trident is not installed or the installed version is not the latest, you need to install the latest version of Trident before proceeding. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[Trident documentation^] for instructions.

+
////
* Check if the snapshot controller and volumesnapshot Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed.
+
----
kubectl get sts -A | grep -i snapshot
----
+
If the snapshot controller is installed, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
default     snapshot-controller   1/1     5h18m
----
+
NOTE: The snapshot controller does not have to be installed in the `default` namespace.
+
If the snapshot controller is not installed, you get the following message:
+
----
No resources found
----
////

. Check if the storage classes are using the supported Trident drivers. The provisioner name should be `csi.trident.netapp.io`. See the following example:
+
----
kubectl get sc
NAME                   PROVISIONER                    RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
ontap-gold (default)   csi.trident.netapp.io          Delete          Immediate           true                   5d23h
thin                   kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume   Delete          Immediate           false                  6d
----

== Create an admin-role kubeconfig

Ensure that you have the following on your machine before you do the steps:

* `kubectl` v1.19 or later installed
* An active kubeconfig with cluster admin rights for the active context

.Steps
. Create a service account as follows:
.. Create a service account file called `astracontrol-service-account.yaml`.
+
Adjust the name and namespace as needed. If changes are made here, you should apply the same changes in the following steps.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*astracontrol-service-account.yaml*
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: astracontrol-service-account
  namespace: default
----
.. Apply the service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f astracontrol-service-account.yaml
----
. (Optional) If your cluster uses a restrictive pod security policy that doesn't allow privileged pod creation or allow processes within the pod containers to run as the root user, create a custom pod security policy for the cluster that enables Astra Control to create and manage pods. For instructions, see link:acc-create-podsecuritypolicy.html[Create a custom pod security policy].
. Grant cluster admin permissions as follows:
.. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` file called `astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml`.
+
Adjust any names and namespaces modified when creating the service account as needed.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml*
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: astracontrol-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: astracontrol-service-account
  namespace: default
----
.. Apply the cluster role binding:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml
----
. List the service account secrets, replacing `<context>` with the correct context for your installation:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get serviceaccount astracontrol-service-account --context <context> --namespace default -o json
----
+
The end of the output should look similar to the following:
+
----
"secrets": [
{ "name": "astracontrol-service-account-dockercfg-vhz87"},
{ "name": "astracontrol-service-account-token-r59kr"}
]
----
+
The indices for each element in the `secrets` array begin with 0. In the above example, the index for `astracontrol-service-account-dockercfg-vhz87` would be 0 and the index for `astracontrol-service-account-token-r59kr` would be 1. In your output, make note of the index for the service account name that has the word "token" in it.
. Generate the kubeconfig as follows:
.. Create a `create-kubeconfig.sh` file. Replace `TOKEN_INDEX` in the beginning of the following script with the correct value.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*create-kubeconfig.sh*
----
+
[source,sh]
----
# Update these to match your environment.
# Replace TOKEN_INDEX with the correct value
# from the output in the previous step. If you
# didn't change anything else above, don't change
# anything else here.

TOKEN=$(echo ${TOKEN_DATA} | base64 -d)

# Create dedicated kubeconfig
# Create a full copy
kubectl config view --raw > ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.full.tmp

# Switch working context to correct context
kubectl --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.full.tmp config use-context ${CONTEXT}

# Minify
kubectl --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.full.tmp \
  config view --flatten --minify > ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp

# Rename context
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  rename-context ${CONTEXT} ${NEW_CONTEXT}

# Create token user
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-${NAMESPACE}-token-user \
  --token ${TOKEN}

# Set context to use token user
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-context ${NEW_CONTEXT} --user ${CONTEXT}-${NAMESPACE}-token-user

# Set context to correct namespace
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-context ${NEW_CONTEXT} --namespace ${NAMESPACE}

# Flatten/minify kubeconfig
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  view --flatten --minify > ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}

# Remove tmp
rm ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.full.tmp
rm ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp
----
.. Source the commands to apply them to your Kubernetes cluster.
+
[source,sh]
----
source create-kubeconfig.sh
----
. (*Optional*) Rename the kubeconfig to a meaningful name for your cluster. Protect your cluster credential.
+
[source,sh]
----
