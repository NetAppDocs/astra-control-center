[.lead]
After you install Astra Control Center, log in to the UI, and change your password, you'll want to set up a license, add clusters, manage storage, and add buckets.

.Tasks
* <<Add a license for Astra Control Center>>
* <<Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control>>
* <<Add cluster>>
* <<Add a storage backend>>
* <<Add a bucket>>

== Add a license for Astra Control Center
//REFERENCED IN UI and NSS downloads. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS.
You can add a new license using the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[API^] to gain full Astra Control Center functionality. Without a license, your usage of Astra Control Center is limited to managing users and adding new clusters.

Astra Control Center licenses measure CPU resources using Kubernetes CPU units and account for the CPU resources assigned to the worker nodes of all the managed Kubernetes clusters. Licenses are based on vCPU usage. For more information on how licenses are calculated, refer to link:../concepts/licensing.html[Licensing^].

NOTE: If your installation grows to exceed the licensed number of CPU units, Astra Control Center prevents you from managing new applications. An alert is displayed when capacity is exceeded.

NOTE: To update an existing evaluation or full license, refer to link:../use/update-licenses.html[Update an existing license^].

.What you'll need

* Access to a newly installed Astra Control Center instance.

* Administrator role permissions.

* A link:../concepts/licensing.html[NetApp License File^] (NLF).  

.Steps
. Log in to the Astra Control Center UI.
. Select *Account* > *License*.
. Select *Add License*.
. Browse to the license file (NLF) that you downloaded.
. Select *Add License*.

The *Account* > *License* page displays the license information, expiration date, license serial number, account ID, and CPU units used.

//AD AH review q2

NOTE: If you have an evaluation license and are not sending data to AutoSupport, be sure that you store your account ID to avoid data loss in the event of Astra Control Center failure.

== Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control

You should ensure that the following prerequisite conditions are met before you add a cluster. You should also run eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center and create roles for cluster management.
//THIS SECTION REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY TITLE OR URL WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.

.What you'll need

* Ensure that the worker nodes in your cluster are configured with the appropriate storage drivers so that the pods can interact with the backend storage.
* Your environment meets the link:../get-started/requirements.html#operational-environment-requirements[operational environment requirements^] for Astra Trident and Astra Control Center. 
*	A version of Astra Trident that is link:../get-started/requirements.html#operational-environment-requirements[supported by Astra Control Center^] is installed:
+
NOTE: You can https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html#choose-the-deployment-method[deploy Astra Trident^] using either Trident operator (manually or using Helm chart) or `tridentctl`. Prior to installing or upgrading Astra Trident, review the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html[supported frontends, backends, and host configurations^].

** *Trident storage backend configured*: At least one Astra Trident storage backend must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-postdeployment.html#step-1-create-a-backend[configured^] on the cluster.
** *Trident storage classes configured*: At least one Astra Trident storage class must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/manage-stor-class.html[configured^] on the cluster. If a default storage class is configured, ensure that it is the only storage class that has the default annotation.
** *Astra Trident volume snapshot controller and volume snapshot class installed and configured*: The volume snapshot controller must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html#deploying-a-volume-snapshot-controller[installed^] so that snapshots can be created in Astra Control. At least one Astra Trident `VolumeSnapshotClass` has been https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html#step-1-set-up-a-volumesnapshotclass[set up^] by an administrator.
* *Kubeconfig accessible*: You have access to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[cluster kubeconfig^] that includes only one context element.
* *ONTAP credentials*: You need ONTAP credentials and a superuser and user ID set on the backing ONTAP system to back up and restore apps with Astra Control Center. 
+
Run the following commands in the ONTAP command line:
+
----
export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name> -ruleindex 1 -superuser sys
export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name> -ruleindex 1 -anon 65534
----

* *Rancher only*: When managing application clusters in a Rancher environment, modify the application cluster's default context in the kubeconfig file provided by Rancher to use a control plane context instead of the Rancher API server context. This reduces load on the Rancher API server and improves performance.

=== Run eligibility checks

Run the following eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center.

.Steps

. Check the Trident version.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get tridentversions -n trident
----
+
If Trident exists, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
NAME      VERSION
trident   22.10.0
----
+
If Trident does not exist, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "tridentversions"
----
+
NOTE: If Trident is not installed or the installed version is not the latest, you need to install the latest version of Trident before proceeding. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[Trident documentation^] for instructions.

. Ensure that the pods are running:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get pods -n trident
----

. Determine if the storage classes are using the supported Trident drivers. The provisioner name should be `csi.trident.netapp.io`. See the following example:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get sc
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
NAME                  PROVISIONER            RECLAIMPOLICY  VOLUMEBINDINGMODE  ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION  AGE
ontap-gold (default)  csi.trident.netapp.io  Delete         Immediate          true                  5d23h
----

=== Create a limited cluster role kubeconfig

You can optionally create a limited administrator role for Astra Control Center. This is not a required procedure for Astra Control Center setup. This procedure helps create a separate kubeconfig that limits Astra Control permissions on the clusters it manages. 

.What you'll need

Ensure that you have the following for the cluster you intend to manage before completing the procedure steps:

* kubectl v1.23 or later installed
* kubectl access to the cluster that you intend to add and manage with Astra Control Center
+
NOTE: For this procedure, you do not need kubectl access to the cluster that is running Astra Control Center.

* An active kubeconfig for the cluster you intend to manage with cluster admin rights for the active context

=== What's next?

Now that you've verified that the prerequisites are met, you're ready to <<Add cluster,add a cluster>>.


== Add cluster
//REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.
To begin managing your apps, add a Kubernetes cluster and manage it as a compute resource. You have to add a cluster for Astra Control Center to discover your Kubernetes applications.

TIP: We recommend that Astra Control Center manage the cluster it is deployed on first before you add other clusters to Astra Control Center to manage. Having the initial cluster under management is necessary to send Kubemetrics data and cluster-associated data for metrics and troubleshooting.

.What you'll need

* Before you add a cluster, review and perform the necessary <<Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control,prerequisite tasks>>.

.Steps
. Navigate from either the Dashboard or the Clusters menu:
* From *Dashboard* in the Resource Summary, select *Add* from the Clusters pane.
* In the left navigation area, select *Clusters* and then select *Add Cluster* from the Clusters page.
. In the *Add Cluster* window that opens, upload a `kubeconfig.yaml` file or paste the contents of a `kubeconfig.yaml` file.
+
NOTE: The `kubeconfig.yaml` file should include *only the cluster credential for one cluster*.
+
IMPORTANT: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files. If you created a kubeconfig for a limited cluster role using <<Create a limited cluster role kubeconfig,the process above>>, be sure to upload or paste that kubeconfig in this step.

. Provide a credential name. By default, the credential name is auto-populated as the name of the cluster.
. Select *Next*.
. Select the default storage class to be used for this Kubernetes cluster, and select *Next*.
+
NOTE: You should select a Trident storage class backed by ONTAP storage.

. Review the information, and if everything looks good, select *Add*.

.Result

The cluster enters *Discovering* state and then changes to *Healthy*. You are now managing the cluster with Astra Control Center.

IMPORTANT: After you add a cluster to be managed in Astra Control Center, it might take a few minutes to deploy the monitoring operator. Until then, the Notification icon turns red and logs a *Monitoring Agent Status Check Failed* event. You can ignore this, because the issue resolves when Astra Control Center obtains the correct status. If the issue does not resolve in a few minutes, go to the cluster, and run `oc get pods -n netapp-monitoring` as the starting point. You will need to look into the monitoring operator logs to debug the problem.

== Add a storage backend

You can add an existing ONTAP storage backend to Astra Control Center to manage its resources.

Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend as well as additional storage metrics.


.Steps

. From the Dashboard in the left-navigation area, select *Backends*.
. Do one of the following:
** *New backends*: Select *Add* to manage an existing backend, select *ONTAP*, and select *Next*.
** *Discovered backends*: From the Actions menu, select *Manage* on a discovered backend from the managed cluster.
. Enter the ONTAP cluster management IP address and admin credentials. The credentials must be cluster-wide credentials. 
+
NOTE: The user whose credentials you enter here must have the `ontapi` user login access method enabled within ONTAP System Manager on the ONTAP cluster. If you plan to use SnapMirror replication, apply user credentials with the "admin" role, which has the access methods `ontapi` and `http`, on both source and destination ONTAP clusters. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/concept_cluster_user_accounts.html#users-list[Manage User Accounts in ONTAP documentation^] for more information.

. Select *Next*.
. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.


.Result
The backend appears in the `Healthy` state in the list with summary information.

NOTE: You might need to refresh the page for the backend to appear.

== Add a bucket

You can add a bucket using the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[API^]. Adding object store bucket providers is essential if you want to back up your applications and persistent storage or if you want to clone applications across clusters. Astra Control stores those backups or clones in the object store buckets that you define.

You don't need a bucket in Astra Control if you are cloning your application configuration and persistent storage to the same cluster. Application snapshots functionality does not require a bucket.

.What you'll need

* A bucket that is reachable from your clusters managed by Astra Control Center.
* Credentials for the bucket.
* A bucket of the following types:

** NetApp ONTAP S3
** NetApp StorageGRID S3
** Microsoft Azure
** Generic S3


NOTE: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) use the Generic S3 bucket type.

NOTE: Although Astra Control Center supports Amazon S3 as a Generic S3 bucket provider, Astra Control Center might not support all object store vendors that claim Amazon's S3 support.

.Steps

. In the left navigation area, select *Buckets*.
. Select *Add*.
. Select the bucket type.
+
NOTE: When you add a bucket, select the correct bucket provider and provide the right credentials for that provider. For example, the UI accepts NetApp ONTAP S3 as the type and accepts StorageGRID credentials; however, this will cause all future app backups and restores using this bucket to fail.

. Enter an existing bucket name and optional description.
+
TIP: The bucket name and description appear as a backup location that you can choose later when you're creating a backup. The name also appears during protection policy configuration.

. Enter the name or IP address of the S3 endpoint. 

. Under *Select Credentials*, choose either the *Add* or *Use existing* tab.
* If you chose *Add*: 
.. Enter a name for the credential that distinguishes it from other credentials in Astra Control.
.. Enter the access ID and secret key by pasting the contents from your clipboard.
* If you chose *Use existing*:
..  Select the existing credentials you want to use with the bucket.

. Select `Add`.
+
NOTE: When you add a bucket, Astra Control marks one bucket with the default bucket indicator. The first bucket that you create becomes the default bucket. As you add buckets, you can later decide to link:../use/manage-buckets.html#set-the-default-bucket[set another default bucket^].


== What's next?

Now that you've logged in and added clusters to Astra Control Center, you're ready to start using Astra Control Center's application data management features.
