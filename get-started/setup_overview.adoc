== Add a license for Astra Control Center
//REFERENCED IN UI and NSS downloads. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS.
You can add a new license using the UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[API^] to gain full Astra Control Center functionality. Without a license, your usage of Astra Control Center is limited to managing users and adding new clusters.

For more information on how licenses are calculated, see link:../concepts/licensing.html[Licensing].

NOTE: To update an existing evaluation or full license, see link:../use/update-licenses.html[Update an existing license].

Astra Control Center licenses measure CPU resources using Kubernetes CPU units. The license needs to account for the CPU resources assigned to the worker nodes of all the managed Kubernetes clusters. Before you add a license, you need to obtain the license file (NLF) from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].

You can also try Astra Control Center with an evaluation license, which lets you use Astra Control Center for 90 days from the date you download the license. You can sign up for a free trial by registering link:https://cloud.netapp.com/astra-register[here^].

NOTE:  If your installation grows to exceed the licensed number of CPU units, Astra Control Center prevents you from managing new applications. An alert is displayed when capacity is exceeded.

.What you'll need
When you downloaded Astra Control Center from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], you also downloaded the NetApp license file (NLF). Ensure you have access to this license file.

.Steps
. Log in to the Astra Control Center UI.
. Select *Account* > *License*.
. Select *Add License*.
. Browse to the license file (NLF) that you downloaded.
. Select *Add License*.

The *Account* > *License* page displays the license information, expiration date, license serial number, account ID, and CPU units used.

//AD AH review q2

NOTE: If you have an evaluation license, be sure you store your account ID to avoid data loss in the event of Astra Control Center failure if you are not sending ASUPs.

== Add cluster
//REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.
To begin managing your apps, add a Kubernetes cluster and manage it as a compute resource. You have to add a cluster for Astra Control Center to discover your Kubernetes applications. For Astra Data Store, you want to add the Kubernetes app cluster that contains applications that are using volumes provisioned by Astra Data Store.

TIP: We recommend that Astra Control Center manage the cluster it is deployed on first before you add other clusters to Astra Control Center to manage. Having the initial cluster under management is necessary to send Kubemetrics data and cluster-associated data for metrics and troubleshooting. You can use the *Add Cluster* feature to manage a cluster with Astra Control Center.

[NOTE]
======================
When Astra Control manages a cluster, it keeps track of the cluster's default storage class. If you change the storage class using `kubectl` commands, Astra Control reverts the change. To change the default storage class in a cluster managed by Astra Control, use one of the following methods:

* Use the Astra Control API `PUT /managedClusters` endpoint, and assign a different default storage class with the `DefaultStorageClass` parameter.
* Use the Astra Control web UI to assign a different default storage class. See <<Change the default storage class>>.
======================

.What you'll need

* Before you add a cluster, review and perform the necessary link:add-cluster-reqs.html[prerequisite tasks^].

.Steps
. From the *Dashboard* in the Astra Control Center UI, select *Add* in the Clusters section.
. In the *Add Cluster* window that opens, upload a `kubeconfig.yaml` file or paste the contents of a `kubeconfig.yaml` file.
+
NOTE: The `kubeconfig.yaml` file should include *only the cluster credential for one cluster*.
+
image:cluster-creds.png[Shows the screen to upload kubeconfig.yaml for cluster.]
+
IMPORTANT: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files.

. Provide a credential name. By default, the credential name is auto-populated as the name of the cluster.
. Select *Configure storage*.
. Select the storage class to be used for this Kubernetes cluster, and select *Review*.
+
NOTE: You should select a Trident storage class backed by ONTAP storage or Astra Data Store.
+
image:cluster-storage.png[Shows the storage class to be used for the cluster.]
. Review the information, and if everything looks good, select *Add cluster*.

.Result

The cluster enters the *Discovering* status and then changes to *Running*. You have successfully added a Kubernetes cluster and are now managing it in Astra Control Center.

IMPORTANT: After you add a cluster to be managed in Astra Control Center, it might take a few minutes to deploy the monitoring operator. Until then, the Notification icon turns red and logs a *Monitoring Agent Status Check Failed* event. You can ignore this, because the issue resolves when Astra Control Center obtains the correct status. If the issue does not resolve in a few minutes, go to the cluster, and run `oc get pods -n netapp-monitoring` as the starting point. You will need to look into the monitoring operator logs to debug the problem.

== Add a storage backend

You can add a storage backend so that Astra Control can manage its resources. You can deploy a storage backend on a managed cluster or use an existing storage backend.

Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend as well as additional storage metrics.

.What you'll need for existing Astra Data Store deployments

* You have added your Kubernetes app cluster and the underlying compute cluster.
+
IMPORTANT: After you add your Kubernetes app cluster for Astra Data Store and it is managed by Astra Control, the cluster appears as `unmanaged` in the list of discovered backends. You must next add the compute cluster that contains Astra Data Store and underlies the Kubernetes app cluster. You can do this from *Backends* in the UI. Select the Actions menu for the cluster, select `Manage`, and link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[add the cluster]. After the cluster state of `unmanaged` changes to the name of the Kubernetes cluster, you can proceed with adding a backend.

.What you'll need for new Astra Data Store deployments

* You have link:../use/manage-packages-acc.html[uploaded the version of the installation bundle you intend to deploy] to a location that is accessible to Astra Control.

* You have added the Kubernetes cluster that you intend to use for deployment.

* You have uploaded the <<Add a license for Astra Control Center,Astra Data Store license>> for your deployment to a location that is accessible to Astra Control.

//* You have the IPs you need for the new Astra Data Store.

//* You have the node label you intend to use for the K8s worker nodes for ADS.

.Options

* <<Deploy storage resources>>
* <<Use an existing storage backend>>

=== Deploy storage resources
You can deploy a new Astra Data Store and manage the associated storage backend.

.Steps
. Navigate from the Dashboard or the Backends menu:
* From *Dashboard*: From the Resource Summary, select a link from the Storage Backends pane and select *Add* from the Backends section.
* From *Backends*:
.. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
.. Select *Add*.
. Select the *Astra Data Store* deployment option within the *Deploy* tab.
. Select the Astra Data Store package to deploy:
.. Enter a name for the Astra Data Store application.
.. Choose the version of Astra Data Store you want to deploy.
+
NOTE: If you have not yet uploaded the version you intend to deploy, you can use the *Add package* option or exit the wizard and use link:../use/manage-packages-acc.html[package management] to upload the installation bundle.

. Select an Astra Data Store license that you have previously uploaded or use the *Add license* option to upload a license to use with the application.
+
NOTE: Astra Data Store licenses with full permissions are associated with your Kubernetes cluster, and these associated clusters should appear automatically. If there is no managed cluster, you can select the *Add a Cluster* option to add one to Astra Control management.
For Astra Data Store licenses, if no association has been made between the license and cluster, you can define this association on the next page of the wizard.

. If you have not added a Kubernetes cluster to Astra Control management, you need to do so from the *Kubernetes cluster* page. Select an existing cluster from the list or select *add the underlying cluster* to add a cluster to Astra Control management.
. Select a template size for the Kubernetes cluster that will provide resources for Astra Data Store. You can choose one of the following:
+
* If you choose `Recommended Kubernetes worker node requirements`, select a template from large to small based on what your license allows.

* If you choose `Custom Kubernetes worker node requirements`, select the number of cores and total memory you want for each cluster node. You can also show the eligible number of nodes in the cluster that meet your selection criteria for cores and memory.
+
TIP: When picking a template, select larger nodes with more memory and cores for larger workloads or a greater number of nodes for smaller workloads. You should select a template based on what your license allows. Each recommended template option suggests the number of eligible nodes that satisfy the template pattern for memory and cores and capacity for each node.

. Configure the nodes:
.. Add a node label to identify the pool of worker nodes that supports this Astra Data Store cluster.
+
IMPORTANT: The label must be added to each individual node in the cluster that will be used for Astra Data Store deployment prior to the start of deployment or deployment will fail.

.. Configure the capacity (GiB) per node manually or select the maximum node capacity allowed.
.. Configure a maximum number of nodes allowed in the cluster or allow the maximum number of nodes on the cluster.
. (Astra Data Store full licenses only) Enter the key of the label you want to use for Protection Domains.
+
NOTE: Create at least three unique labels for the key for each node. For example, if your key is `astra.datastore.protection.domain`, you might create the following labels: `astra.datastore.protection.domain=domain1`,`astra.datastore.protection.domain=domain2`, and `astra.datastore.protection.domain=domain3`.

. Configure the management network:
.. Enter a management IP address for Astra Data Store internal management that is on the same subnet as worker node IP addresses.
.. Choose to use the same NIC for both management and data networks or configure them separately.
.. Enter data network IP address pool, subnet mask and gateway for storage access.
. Review the configuration and select *Deploy* to begin installation.

.Result
After a successful installation, the backend appears in `available` state in the backends list along with active performance information.

NOTE: You might need to refresh the page for the backend to appear.

=== Use an existing storage backend

You can bring a discovered ONTAP or Astra Data Store storage backend into Astra Control Center management.

.Steps

. Navigate from the Dashboard or the Backends menu:
* From *Dashboard*: From the Resource Summary, select a link from the Storage Backends pane and select *Add* from the Backends section.
* From *Backends*:
.. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
.. Select *Manage* on a discovered backend from the managed cluster or select *Add* to manage an additional existing backend.
. Select the *Use existing* tab.
. Do one of the following depending on your backend type:
* *Astra Data Store*:
.. Select *Astra Data Store*.
.. Select the managed compute cluster and select *Next*.
.. Confirm the backend details and select *Add storage backend*.

* *ONTAP*:
.. Select *ONTAP* and select *Next*.
.. Enter the ONTAP cluster management IP address and admin credentials.
+
NOTE: The user whose credentials you enter here must have the `ontapi` user login access method enabled within ONTAP System Manager on the ONTAP cluster. If you plan to use SnapMirror replication, enable the access methods `ontapi` and `http` for the user on both ONTAP clusters. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/concept_cluster_user_accounts.html#users-list[Manage User Accounts^] for more information.

.. Select *Review*.
.. Confirm the backend details and select *Add storage backend*.

.Result
The backend appears in `available` state in the list with summary information.

NOTE: You might need to refresh the page for the backend to appear.

== Add a bucket

Adding object store bucket providers is essential if you want to back up your applications and persistent storage or if you want to clone applications across clusters. Astra Control stores those backups or clones in the object store buckets that you define.

When you add a bucket, Astra Control marks one bucket as the default bucket indicator. The first bucket that you create becomes the default bucket.

You don’t need a bucket if you are cloning your application configuration and persistent storage to the same cluster.

Use any of the following bucket types:

* NetApp ONTAP S3
* NetApp StorageGRID S3
* Generic S3
+
NOTE: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) use the Generic S3 bucket type.
* Microsoft Azure


+
NOTE: Although Astra Control Center supports Amazon S3 as a Generic S3 bucket provider, Astra Control Center might not support all object store vendors that claim Amazon’s S3 support.

* Microsoft Azure

For instructions on how to add buckets using the Astra Control API, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information^].

.Steps

. In the left navigation area, select *Buckets*.
.. Select *Add*.
.. Select the bucket type.
+
NOTE: When you add a bucket, select the correct bucket provider and provide the right credentials for that provider. For example, the UI accepts NetApp ONTAP S3 as the type and accepts StorageGRID credentials; however, this will cause all future app backups and restores using this bucket to fail.

.. Create a new bucket name or enter an existing bucket name and optional description.
+
TIP: The bucket name and description appear as a backup location that you can choose later when you’re creating a backup. The name also appears during protection policy configuration.

.. Enter the name or IP address of the S3 endpoint.
.. If you want this bucket to be the default bucket for all backups, check the `Make this bucket the default bucket for this private cloud` option.
+
NOTE: This option does not appear for the first bucket you create.

.. Continue by adding <<Add S3 access credentials,credential information>>.

=== Add S3 access credentials

Add S3 access credentials at any time.

.Steps

. From the Buckets dialog, select either the *Add* or *Use existing* tab.
.. Enter a name for the credential that distinguishes it from other credentials in Astra Control.
.. Enter the access ID and secret key by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

== Change the default storage class
You can change the default storage class for a cluster.

.Steps

. In the Astra Control Center web UI, select *Clusters*.
. On the *Clusters* page, select the cluster that you want to change.
. Select the *Storage* tab.
. Select the *Storage classes* category.
. Select the *Actions* menu for the storage class that you want to set as default.
. Select *Set as default*.

== What's next?

Now that you’ve logged in and added clusters to Astra Control Center, you're ready to start using Astra Control Center's application data management features.
