Astra Control Center supports and monitors ONTAP as the storage backend. After you install Astra Control Center, log in to the UI, and change your password, you'll want to set up a license, add clusters, manage storage, and add buckets.

.Tasks
* <<Add a license for Astra Control Center>>
* <<Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control>>
* <<Add cluster>>
* <<Add a storage backend>>
* <<Add a bucket>>
* <<Change the default storage class>>

== Add a license for Astra Control Center
//REFERENCED IN UI and NSS downloads. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS.
You can add a new license using the UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[API^] to gain full Astra Control Center functionality. Without a license, your usage of Astra Control Center is limited to managing users and adding new clusters.

For more information on how licenses are calculated, see link:../concepts/licensing.html[Licensing].

NOTE: To update an existing evaluation or full license, see link:../use/update-licenses.html[Update an existing license].

Astra Control Center licenses measure CPU resources using Kubernetes CPU units. The license needs to account for the CPU resources assigned to the worker nodes of all the managed Kubernetes clusters. Before you add a license, you need to obtain the license file (NLF) from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].

You can also try Astra Control Center with an evaluation license, which lets you use Astra Control Center for 90 days from the date you download the license. You can sign up for a free trial by registering link:https://cloud.netapp.com/astra-register[here^].

NOTE:  If your installation grows to exceed the licensed number of CPU units, Astra Control Center prevents you from managing new applications. An alert is displayed when capacity is exceeded.

.What you'll need
When you downloaded Astra Control Center from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], you also downloaded the NetApp license file (NLF). Ensure you have access to this license file.

.Steps
. Log in to the Astra Control Center UI.
. Select *Account* > *License*.
. Select *Add License*.
. Browse to the license file (NLF) that you downloaded.
. Select *Add License*.

The *Account* > *License* page displays the license information, expiration date, license serial number, account ID, and CPU units used.

//AD AH review q2

NOTE: If you have an evaluation license, be sure you store your account ID to avoid data loss in the event of Astra Control Center failure if you are not sending ASUPs.

== Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control

You should ensure that the following prerequisite conditions are met before you add a cluster. You should also run eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center and create roles for cluster management.
//THIS SECTION REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.

.What you'll need to add and manage a cluster
* *A cluster that meets requirements*: Ensure that your cluster meets the requirements outlined in link:requirements.html#application-cluster-requirements[Application cluster requirements].
+
NOTE: If you plan to add a second OpenShift 4.6, 4.7, or 4.8 cluster as a managed compute resource, you should ensure that the Astra Trident Volume Snapshot feature is enabled. See the official Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[instructions^] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Astra Trident.

* *Trident storage classes*: Ensure that Astra Trident StorageClasses are configured with a link:requirements.html#supported-storage-backends[supported storage backend] (required for any type of cluster)
* *Astra Trident volumesnapshotclass*: You have an Astra Trident `volumesnapshotclass` object that has been defined by an administrator. See the Astra Trident https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[instructions^] to enable and test Volume Snapshots with Astra Trident.
* *ONTAP credentials*: You have a superuser and user ID set on the backing ONTAP system to back up and restore apps with Astra Control Center. Run the following command in the ONTAP command line:
`export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name>  -ruleindex 1 -superuser sysm --anon 65534`
* *Kubernetes default storage class*: Ensure that you have only a single default storage class defined for your Kubernetes cluster.


=== Run eligibility checks

Run the following eligibility checks to ensure that your cluster is ready to be added to Astra Control Center.

.Steps

. Check the Trident version.
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get tridentversions -n trident
----
+
If Trident exists, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
NAME      VERSION
trident   21.04.0
----
+
If Trident does not exist, you see output similar to the following:
+
----
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "tridentversions"
----
+
NOTE: If Trident is not installed or the installed version is not the latest, you need to install the latest version of Trident before proceeding. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[Trident documentation^] for instructions.

. Check if the storage classes are using the supported Trident drivers. The provisioner name should be `csi.trident.netapp.io`. See the following example:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get sc
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
NAME                   PROVISIONER                    RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
ontap-gold (default)   csi.trident.netapp.io          Delete          Immediate           true                   5d23h
thin                   kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume   Delete          Immediate           false                  6d
----

=== Create an admin-role kubeconfig

Ensure that you have the following on your machine before you do the steps:

* kubectl v1.19 or later installed
* An active kubeconfig with cluster admin rights for the active context

.Steps
. Create a service account as follows:
.. Create a service account file called `astracontrol-service-account.yaml`.
+
Adjust the name and namespace as needed. If changes are made here, you should apply the same changes in the following steps.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*astracontrol-service-account.yaml*
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: astracontrol-service-account
  namespace: default
----
.. Apply the service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f astracontrol-service-account.yaml
----
. (Optional) If your cluster uses a restrictive pod security policy that doesn't allow privileged pod creation or allow processes within the pod containers to run as the root user, create a custom pod security policy for the cluster that enables Astra Control to create and manage pods. For instructions, see link:acc-create-podsecuritypolicy.html[Create a custom pod security policy].
. Grant cluster admin permissions as follows:
.. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` file called `astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml`.
+
Adjust any names and namespaces modified when creating the service account as needed.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml*
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: astracontrol-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: astracontrol-service-account
  namespace: default
----
.. Apply the cluster role binding:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f astracontrol-clusterrolebinding.yaml
----
. List the service account secrets, replacing `<context>` with the correct context for your installation:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get serviceaccount astracontrol-service-account --context <context> --namespace default -o json
----
+
The end of the output should look similar to the following:
+
----
"secrets": [
{ "name": "astracontrol-service-account-dockercfg-vhz87"},
{ "name": "astracontrol-service-account-token-r59kr"}
]
----
+
The indices for each element in the `secrets` array begin with 0. In the above example, the index for `astracontrol-service-account-dockercfg-vhz87` would be 0 and the index for `astracontrol-service-account-token-r59kr` would be 1. In your output, make note of the index for the service account name that has the word "token" in it.
. Generate the kubeconfig as follows:
.. Create a `create-kubeconfig.sh` file. Replace `TOKEN_INDEX` in the beginning of the following script with the correct value.
+
[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*create-kubeconfig.sh*
----
+
[source,sh]
----
# Update these to match your environment.
# Replace TOKEN_INDEX with the correct value
# from the output in the previous step. If you
# didn't change anything else above, don't change
# anything else here.

  rename-context ${CONTEXT} ${NEW_CONTEXT}

# Create token user
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-${NAMESPACE}-token-user \
  --token ${TOKEN}

# Set context to use token user
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-context ${NEW_CONTEXT} --user ${CONTEXT}-${NAMESPACE}-token-user

# Set context to correct namespace
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  set-context ${NEW_CONTEXT} --namespace ${NAMESPACE}

# Flatten/minify kubeconfig
kubectl config --kubeconfig ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp \
  view --flatten --minify > ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}

# Remove tmp
rm ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.full.tmp
rm ${KUBECONFIG_FILE}.tmp
----
.. Source the commands to apply them to your Kubernetes cluster.
+
[source,sh]
----
source create-kubeconfig.sh

=== What's next?

Now that you've verified that the prerequisites are met, you're ready to <<Add cluster,add a cluster>>.


== Add cluster
//REFERENCED IN UI. DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT NOTIFYING UX.
To begin managing your apps, add a Kubernetes cluster and manage it as a compute resource. You have to add a cluster for Astra Control Center to discover your Kubernetes applications.

TIP: We recommend that Astra Control Center manage the cluster it is deployed on first before you add other clusters to Astra Control Center to manage. Having the initial cluster under management is necessary to send Kubemetrics data and cluster-associated data for metrics and troubleshooting.

[NOTE]
======================
When Astra Control manages a cluster, it keeps track of the cluster's default storage class. If you change the storage class using kubectl commands, Astra Control reverts the change. To change the default storage class in a cluster managed by Astra Control, use one of the following methods:

* Use the Astra Control API `PUT /managedClusters` endpoint, and assign a different default storage class with the `DefaultStorageClass` parameter.
* Use the Astra Control web UI to assign a different default storage class. See <<Change the default storage class>>.
======================

.What you'll need

* Before you add a cluster, review and perform the necessary <<Prepare your environment for cluster management using Astra Control,prerequisite tasks>>.

.Steps
. From the *Dashboard* in the Astra Control Center UI, select *Add* in the Clusters section.
. In the *Add Cluster* window that opens, upload a `kubeconfig.yaml` file or paste the contents of a `kubeconfig.yaml` file.
+
NOTE: The `kubeconfig.yaml` file should include *only the cluster credential for one cluster*.
+
image:cluster-creds.png[Shows the screen to upload kubeconfig.yaml for cluster.]
+
IMPORTANT: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files.

. Provide a credential name. By default, the credential name is auto-populated as the name of the cluster.
. Select *Configure storage*.
. Select the storage class to be used for this Kubernetes cluster, and select *Review*.
+
NOTE: You should select a Trident storage class backed by ONTAP storage.
+
image:cluster-storage.png[Shows the storage class to be used for the cluster.]
. Review the information, and if everything looks good, select *Add cluster*.

.Result

The cluster enters the *Discovering* status and then changes to *Running*. You have successfully added a Kubernetes cluster and are now managing it in Astra Control Center.

IMPORTANT: After you add a cluster to be managed in Astra Control Center, it might take a few minutes to deploy the monitoring operator. Until then, the Notification icon turns red and logs a *Monitoring Agent Status Check Failed* event. You can ignore this, because the issue resolves when Astra Control Center obtains the correct status. If the issue does not resolve in a few minutes, go to the cluster, and run `oc get pods -n netapp-monitoring` as the starting point. You will need to look into the monitoring operator logs to debug the problem.

== Add a storage backend

You can use an existing ONTAP storage backend so that Astra Control can manage its resources.

Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend as well as additional storage metrics.


.Steps

. Navigate from the Dashboard or the Backends menu:
* From *Dashboard*: From the Resource Summary, select a link from the Storage Backends pane and select *Add* from the Backends section.
* From *Backends*:
.. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
.. Select *Manage* on a discovered backend from the managed cluster or select *Add* to manage an additional existing backend.
. In the *Use existing* tab, do the following:
.. Select *ONTAP* and select *Next*.
.. Enter the ONTAP cluster management IP address and admin credentials. The credentials must be cluster-wide credentials. 
+
NOTE: The user whose credentials you enter here must have the `ontapi` user login access method enabled within ONTAP System Manager on the ONTAP cluster. If you plan to use SnapMirror replication, apply user credentials with the "admin" role, which has the access methods `ontapi` and `http`, on both ONTAP clusters. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/concept_cluster_user_accounts.html#users-list[Manage User Accounts^] for more information.

. Select *Next*.
. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.


.Result
The backend appears in the `available` state in the list with summary information.

NOTE: You might need to refresh the page for the backend to appear.

== Add a bucket

Adding object store bucket providers is essential if you want to back up your applications and persistent storage or if you want to clone applications across clusters. Astra Control stores those backups or clones in the object store buckets that you define.

When you add a bucket, Astra Control marks one bucket as the default bucket indicator. The first bucket that you create becomes the default bucket.

You don't need a bucket if you are cloning your application configuration and persistent storage to the same cluster.

Use any of the following bucket types:

* NetApp ONTAP S3
* NetApp StorageGRID S3
* Microsoft Azure
* Generic S3
+
NOTE: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) use the Generic S3 bucket type.

+
NOTE: Although Astra Control Center supports Amazon S3 as a Generic S3 bucket provider, Astra Control Center might not support all object store vendors that claim Amazon's S3 support.

For instructions on how to add buckets using the Astra Control API, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information^].

.Steps

. In the left navigation area, select *Buckets*.
. Select *Add*.
. Select the bucket type.
+
NOTE: When you add a bucket, select the correct bucket provider and provide the right credentials for that provider. For example, the UI accepts NetApp ONTAP S3 as the type and accepts StorageGRID credentials; however, this will cause all future app backups and restores using this bucket to fail.

. Create a new bucket name or enter an existing bucket name and optional description.
+
TIP: The bucket name and description appear as a backup location that you can choose later when you're creating a backup. The name also appears during protection policy configuration.

. Enter the name or IP address of the S3 endpoint. 
+
NOTE: This option does not appear for the first bucket you create.

. Continue by adding <<Add S3 access credentials,credential information>>.
. Select *Add*.

NOTE: If you want this bucket to be the default bucket for all backups, see link:../use/manage-buckets.html#set-the-default-bucket[Set the default bucket].

=== Add S3 access credentials

Add S3 access credentials at any time.

.Steps

. From the Buckets dialog, select either the *Add* or *Use existing* tab.
. Enter a name for the credential that distinguishes it from other credentials in Astra Control.
. Enter the access ID and secret key by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

== Change the default storage class
You can change the default storage class for a cluster.

.Steps

. In the Astra Control Center web UI, select *Clusters*.
. On the *Clusters* page, select the cluster that you want to change.
. Select the *Storage* tab.
. Select the *Storage classes* category.
. Select the *Actions* menu for the storage class that you want to set as default.
. Select *Set as default*.

== What's next?

Now that you've logged in and added clusters to Astra Control Center, you're ready to start using Astra Control Center's application data management features.
