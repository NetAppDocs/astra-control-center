[.lead]
You can backup the Astra Control Center application to better ensure resiliency against fatal errors on the Kubernetes cluster where Astra Control Center is running. You can backup and restore Astra Control Center using a secondary Astra Control Center instance or with Astra replication if the underlying storage is using ONTAP.

In this scenario, a second instance of Astra Control Center is deployed and configured in a different fault domain and runs on a different Kubernetes cluster than the primary Astra Control Center instance. The second Astra Control instance is used to back up and potentially restore the primary Astra Control Center instance. A restored Astra Control Center instance will continue to provide application data management for the application cluster applications and restore accessibility to backups and snapshots of those applications.

.Before you begin

Ensure that you have the following before setting up protection scenarios for Astra Control Center:

* *A Kubernetes cluster running the primary Astra Control Center instance*: This cluster hosts the primary Astra Control Center instance which manages application clusters.
* *A second Kubernetes cluster running the secondary Astra Control Center instance*: This cluster hosts the Astra Control Center instance that manages the primary Astra Control Center instance.
* *A third Kubernetes cluster of the same Kubernetes distribution type as the primary*: This cluster will host the restored or replicated instance of Astra Control Center. It must have the same Astra Control Center namespace available that is currently deployed on the primary. For example, if Astra Control Center is deployed in namespace `netapp-acc` on the source cluster, the namespace `netapp-acc` must be available and not used by any applications on the destination Kubernetes cluster. 
* *S3-compatible buckets*: Each Astra Control Center instance has an accessible S3-compatible object storage bucket.
* *A configured load balancer*: The load balancer provides an IP address for Astra and must have network connectivity to the application clusters and both S3 buckets.
* *Clusters meet Astra Control Center requirements*: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/requirements.html#kubernetes-cluster-general-requirements [Each cluster used in Astra Control Center protection meets general Astra Control Center requirements]

.About this task

These procedures describe the necessary steps to restore Astra Control Center to a new cluster using backup and restore or replication. Steps are based on the example configuration depicted here: 

//<Image>

In this example configuration, the following is shown:

* *A Kubernetes cluster running the primary Astra Control Center instance*: 
** OpenShift cluster: ocp-app-qa4
** Astra Control Center primary instance: app-lb-15.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com
* *The second Kubernetes cluster running the secondary Astra Control Center instance*: 
** OpenShift cluster: ocp-app-qa2 
** Astra Control Center secondary instance: app-lb-14.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com
** This cluster will be used for the backup and to provide temporary app data management for ocp-app-qa4 cluster.
* *A third Kubernetes cluster of the same Kubernetes distribution type as the primary that will be used for restore*: 
** OpenShift cluster: ocp-app-qa1cluster
** This cluster will be used for the restore.

Not depicted in the diagram:

* All the clusters have ONTAP backends with Trident installed. 
* OpenShift clusters are using MetalLB as the load balancer. * The snapshot controller and volumeSnapshotClass are also installed on all the clusters as outlined in the prerequisites. 

NOTE: Additionally, ocp-app-qa4 could have applications that are being managed by the primary or secondary Astra Control Center instance. They are not shown here for brevity. 

 
== Backup and restore Astra Control Center

This procedure describes the necessary steps to restore Astra Control Center to a new cluster using backup and restore or replication. 

In this example, Astra Control Center is always installed under the `netapp-acc` namespace and the operator is installed under the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace. 
+
NOTE: Although not described, Astra Control Center operator can also be deployed in the same namespace as the Astra CR.

.Before you begin

* You have installed the primary Astra Control Center on a cluster.
* You have installed the secondary Astra Control Center on a different cluster.

.Steps

. Manage the primary Astra Control Center application and destination cluster from the secondary Astra Control Center instance:
.. Log into the secondary Astra Control Center instance. 
.. link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[Add the primary Astra Control Center cluster] (ocp-app-qa4). 
.. link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[Add the destination cluster] (ocp-app-qa1) that will be used for the restore.

. Manage Astra Control Center and the Astra Control Center operator on the secondary Astra Control Center:
.. From the Applications page, select *Define*.
.. In the *Define application* window, enter the app name (`netapp-acc`).
.. Choose the cluster that is running the primary Astra Control Center (`ocp-app-qa4`) from the *Cluster* drop-down list.
.. Choose the `netapp-acc` namespace for Astra Control Center from the *Namespace* drop-down list.
.. Select *Next*.
.. On the Cluster Resources page, check *Include additional cluster-scoped resources*.
.. Select *Add include rule*.
.. Select the entries shown here, and select *Add*:

//<Image>

.. Select *Next*.
.. Confirm the application information.
.. Select *Define*. 
. After you select *Define*, repeat the Define App process for netapp-acc-operator and select the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace in the Define Application window.

. Backup Astra Control Center and the operator
.. On the secondary Astra Control Center, navigate to the Applications screen by selecting the Applications tab on the left.
If the user clicks on each application, they can set up a protection policy that includes a backup schedule â€“ which create backups of the Astra Control Center applications on a regular basis.Or the user can create an on-demand backup.
Backup Astra Control Center (netapp-acc in below screenshot) then the netapp-acc-operator by clicking on the ellipsis on the right side of the Application, and select "Back up" as shown below.




Step 4: Configure the Disaster Recovery (DR) scenario

Now that Astra Control Center and the operator are backed up, to simulate a DR scenario, uninstall the primary Astra Control Center system.
Procedure here: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/uninstall_acc.html
The reason for doing this is because we are going to restore Astra Control Center to a new cluster and use the same DNS/IP addresses for the newly installed Astra Control Center.


Step 5: Restore Astra Control Center from Backup

Using the secondary Astra Control Center, restore the primary Astra Control Center application from the backup as depicted below. The destination namespace must be the same as the source namespace. In the case where Astra Control Center was deleted from the source cluster, the backups will still exist and perform the same steps.
 


Choose the destination cluster and change the namespace to be the same namespace as the source.
 


Select the backup that was taken earlier:

Select "Restore using original storage classes"
 
Select "Restore all resources"
 
Review then click on "Restore" to start the restore process:

Astra Control Center will be restored to the destination cluster (ocp-app-qa1) and will soon become "Available".



Step 6: Configure Astra Control Center on the destination Cluster
Open a terminal and connect via kubeconfig to the destination cluster that Astra Control Center has been restored to.
Run the following command: kubectl edit acc -n netapp-acc
Change the DNS name under "spec:" to match what the primary cluster's Astra Control Center DNS name is.
Run "nslookup <primary cluster's DNS name>" to determine the IP address of the primary cluster's Astra Control Center DNS name.
Ingress configurations
There are several methods to set up Ingress for load balancing: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/install_acc.html#set-up-ingress-for-load-balancing. 

For this process, the IP address needs to be updated to be the primary cluster's IP address.  Updating the IP address will vary depending on the type of Ingress used.

The below example describes how Metallb would be updated. 

Run the command: "kubectl edit ipaddresspool.metallb.io/first-pool  -n metallb-system"
Replace the IP address in the "spec/addresses:" section with the IP address that nslookup returned, then save the deployment (:wq)
Run the command: "kubectl rollout restart deployment controller -n metallb-system" to restart the metallb controller.
Skip to the "Restore the Astra Control Center Operator" section of this document to complete the restore process.

== Protect Astra Control Center using Replication


This procedure will outline the steps necessary to configure Replication to protect the primary Astra Control Center system.
Information on configuring replication for Astra Control Center is documented here: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/replicate_snapmirror.html
Similar to the above example, Astra Control Center is installed under the netapp-acc namespace and the operator is installed under the netapp-acc-operator namespace.

Step 1: Manage the Primary Astra Control Center Application and Destination Cluster from Secondary Astra Control Center instance
After the primary and secondary Astra Control Center instances are installed per the documentation, log into the secondary Astra Control Center instance and manage the primary Astra Control Center cluster (ocp-app-qa4 in the below image) and the destination cluster (ocp-app-qa1).



Step 2: Manage Astra Control Center and the Astra Control Center Operator
On the secondary Astra Control Center:

Click on the "Clusters" tab on the left
Select the cluster that the primary Astra Control Center is on (e.g. ocp-app-qa4)
Click the "Namespaces" tab
Search for "netapp-acc"
Select netapp-acc and netapp-acc-operator
Click on the Actions dropdown and select "Define as application"
Click on the "View in applications" button at the bottom of the screen.




Step 3: Configure Backends for Replication
Replication requires that the primary Astra Control Center cluster and the destination cluster use two different peered ONTAP storage backends assigned to each cluster.
Once they are peered, they will appear on the Backends page of the UI under the "Discovered" tab.

Manage both peered backends.


 Step 4: Configure Replication
On the Applications screen, click on the "netapp-acc" application.

 
Click on "Configure replication policy"

Select "ocp-app-qa1" as the destination.
Select the storage class.
Enter "netapp-acc" as the destination namespace.
Change the replication frequency if desired.
Click "Next"

Confirm the configuration is correct, click "Save"

The replication will transition from "Establishing" to "Established".
 
While this replication is active it will replicate every 5 minutes until the replication configuration is deleted.

Step 5: Failover the Replication

If the primary system is corrupted or no longer accessible, we can now do a failover to the other cluster.
NOTE: Make sure the destination cluster does not have Astra Control Center installed to ensure a successful failover.?? Need to confirm this.
Click on the ellipse and select "Fail over".


Click the "Fail over" button to start the failover process:

The status will change to "Failing over" and will soon change to "Failed over".





Step 6: Complete the failover configuration
Open a terminal and connect via the new cluster's kubeconfig that has Astra Control Center installed.
Run the following command: "kubectl edit acc -n netapp-acc"
Change the "astraAddress" under the "spec:" section in this configuration file to the destination DNS address
Re-run "kubectl get acc -n netapp-acc" and confirm that the Address has been updated.
Confirm that all required traefik CRDs are present: "kubectl get crds | grep traefik" (NOTE: the containo* CRDs may be removed in Astra version 23.08).

If some of the above CRDs are missing:
Go to this page: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd/
Copy the "Definitions" area into a file.
Run the following command: "kubectl apply -f <file name>"
Run this command to restart traefik (this assumes Astra Control Center is deployed in the netapp-acc namespace): "kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc | grep -e "traefik" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod -n netapp-acc"
Ingress configurations
There are several methods to set up Ingress for load balancing: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/install_acc.html#set-up-ingress-for-load-balancing. 

For this process, the Ingress/Loadbalancer that holds IP address needs to be restarted because the Astra Control Center DNS address was updated.  

The below example describes how Metallb would be restarted. 

Run the following command: "kubectl edit ipaddresspool.metallb.io/first-pool  -n metallb-system"
Confirm the IP address in the "spec/addresses:" section is the IP address of the destination cluster, save the deployment (:wq)
Regardless if metallb needed updating, restart metallb: "kubectl rollout restart deployment controller -n metallb-system" 
Proceed to the "Restore the Astra Control Center Operator" section below.



Restore the Astra Control Center Operator

Using the secondary Astra Control Center, restore the primary Astra Control Center operator from the backup as depicted below. The destination namespace must be the same as the source namespace. In the case where Astra Control Center was deleted from the source cluster, the backups will still exist and perform the same steps.




Choose the destination cluster and change the namespace to be the same namespace as the source.

 

Select the backup that was taken earlier:
 


Select "Restore using original storage classes"


Select "Restore all resources"



Review then click on "Restore" to start the restore process:
 

The UI will show the Astra Control Center operator being restored to the destination cluster (ocp-app-qa1) and will eventually become "Available".
Within ten minutes, the DNS address should resolve in the UI.



Troubleshooting
If unable to connect to the UI, the following commands may help diagnose the issue.

"kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc" â€“ confirm that all pods are up and running. If some pods are in the "CrashLookBackOff" state, try restarting them and they should transition to the "Running" state.
"kubectl get acc -n netapp-acc" to confirm the Astra Control Center system is in the ready state:
NAME UUID VERSION ADDRESS READY
astra 89f4fd47-0cf0-4c7a-a44e-43353dc96ba8 23.07.0-24 app-lb-15.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com True

"kubectl describe acc astra -n netapp-acc" â€“ shows the Astra Control Center deployment informationan. The "Deployment State" should be in the "Deployed" state
Restart traefik:
"kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc | grep -e "traefik" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod -n netapp-acc"
Restart the Load Balancer. 
If using metallb:   "kubectl rollout restart deployment controller -n metallb-system" 
Conclusion
Astra Control Center, its registered clusters and managed applications with their snapshots and backups are now available on the destination cluster. Any protection policies you had on the original are also there on the new instance. You can continue to take scheduled or on-demand backups and snapshots.
