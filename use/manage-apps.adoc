After you link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[add a cluster to Astra Control management], you can install apps on the cluster (outside of Astra Control) and then go to the Applications page in Astra Control to start managing the apps and their resources.

== App management requirements
Astra Control has the following app management requirements:

* *Licensing*: To manage apps using Astra Control Center, you need an Astra Control Center license.
* *Namespaces*: Astra Control requires that an app not span more than a single namespace, but a namespace can contain more than one app.
* *StorageClass*: If you install an app with a StorageClass explicitly set and you need to clone the app, the target cluster for the clone operation must have the originally specified StorageClass. Cloning an application with an explicitly set StorageClass to a cluster that does not have the same StorageClass will fail.
* *Kubernetes resources*: Apps that use Kubernetes Resources not collected by Astra Control might not have full app data management capabilities. Astra Control collects the following Kubernetes resources:

=== Supported app installation methods
Astra Control supports the following application installation methods:

* *Manifest file*: Astra Control supports apps installed from a manifest file using kubectl. For example:
+
----
kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml
----
* *Helm 3*: If you use Helm to install apps, Astra Control requires Helm version 3. Managing and cloning apps installed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) are fully supported. Managing apps installed with Helm 2 is not supported.
* *Operator-deployed apps*: Astra Control supports apps installed with namespace-scoped operators. These operators are generally designed with a "pass-by-value" rather than "pass-by-reference" architecture. The following are some operator apps that follow these patterns:
** https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/tree/v1.7.1[Apache K8ssandra^]
+
NOTE: For K8ssandra, in-place restore operations are supported. A restore operation to a new namespace or cluster requires that the original instance of the application to be taken down. This is to ensure that the peer group information carried over does not lead to cross-instance communication. Cloning of the app is not supported.

** https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[Jenkins CI^]
** https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator[Percona XtraDB Cluster^]

Astra Control might not be able to clone an operator that is designed with a “pass-by-reference” architecture (for example, the CockroachDB operator). During these types of cloning operations, the cloned operator attempts to reference Kubernetes secrets from the source operator despite having its own new secret as part of the cloning process. The clone operation might fail because Astra Control is unaware of the Kubernetes secrets in the source operator.

NOTE: An operator and the app it installs must use the same namespace; you might need to modify the deployment .yaml file for the operator to ensure this is the case.

== Install apps on your cluster

After you've link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[added your cluster] to Astra Control, you can install apps or manage existing apps on the cluster. Any app that is scoped to a namespace can be managed. After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra Control.

== Manage apps

Astra Control enables you to manage your apps at the namespace level or by Kubernetes label.

.What you'll need
* A cluster added to Astra Control.
* One or more installed apps on the cluster. <<Supported app installation methods,Read more about supported app installation methods>>.
* link:../use/manage-apps.html#what-about-system-apps[Understand managing standard and system apps]

NOTE: For instructions on how to manage apps using the Astra Control API, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information^].

.App management options

* <<Manage apps by namespace>>
* <<Manage apps by Kubernetes label>>
//*	<<Rename apps>>
*	<<Unmanage apps>>

=== Manage apps by namespace or label

You can choose to manage an app individually or at the namespace level. It all comes down to the level of granularity that you need for data protection operations.

Although Astra Control enables you to separately manage both levels of the hierarchy (the namespace and the apps in that namespace), the best practice is to choose one or the other. Actions that you take in Astra Control can fail if the actions take place at the same time at both the namespace and app level.

TIP: As an example, you might want to set a backup policy for "maria" that has a weekly cadence, but you might need to back up "mariadb" (which is in the same namespace) more frequently than that. Based on those needs, you would need to manage the apps separately and not under a single namespace.

.Steps

. Navigate from the Dashboard or the Backends menu:
* From *Dashboard*: From the Resource Summary, select a link from the Storage Backends pane and select *Add* from the Backends section.
* From *Backends*:
.. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
.. Select *Add*.
. Select the *Astra Data Store* deployment option within the *Deploy* tab.
. Select the Astra Data Store package to deploy:
.. Enter a name for the Astra Data Store application.
.. Choose the version of Astra Data Store you want to deploy.
+

. From the left navigation bar, select *Applications*.
. Select the *Discovered* filter.
+
.	View the list of discovered namespaces. Expand the namespace to view the apps and associated resources.
+
Astra Control shows you the Helm apps and custom-labeled apps in the namespace. If Helm labels are available, they’re designated with a tag icon.
. Look at the *Group* column to see which namespace the application is running in (it's designated with the folder icon).
.	Decide whether you want to manage each app individually or at the namespace level.
.	Find the app you want at the desired level in the hierarchy, and select *Manage* from the Options menu in the *Actions* column.
.	If you don’t want to manage an app, select *Ignore* from the Options menu in the *Actions* column.
+
For example, if you want to manage all apps under the "maria" namespace together so that they have the same snapshot and backup policies, you would manage the namespace and ignore the apps in the namespace.

.	To see the list of managed apps, select *Managed* as the display filter.
+
NOTE: The app you just added might have a warning icon under the Protected column, indicating that it is not backed up and not scheduled for backups yet.

.	To see details of a particular app, select the app name.


.Result

Apps that you chose to manage are now available from the *Managed* tab. Any ignored apps will move to the *Ignored* tab. Ideally, the Discovered tab will show zero apps, so that as new apps are installed, they are easier to find and manage.

=== Manage apps by Kubernetes label

Astra Control includes an action at the top of the Applications page named *Define custom app*. You can use this action to manage apps that are identified with a Kubernetes label. link:../use/define-custom-app.html[Learn more about defining custom apps by Kubernetes label].

.Steps

. From the left navigation bar, select *Applications*.
. Select *Define*.
. In the *Define custom application* dialog box, provide the required information to manage the app:

.. *New App*: Enter the display name of the app.

.. *Cluster*: Select the cluster where the app resides.

.. *Namespace:* Select the namespace for the app.

.. *Label:* Enter a label or select a label from the resources below.

.. *Selected Resources*: View and manage the selected Kubernetes resources that you'd like to protect (pods, secrets, persistent volumes, and more).
+
** View the available labels by expanding a resource and selecting the number of labels.
** Select one of the labels.
+
After you choose a label, it displays in the *Label* field. Astra Control also updates the *Unselected Resources* section to show the resources that don't match the selected label.

.. *Unselected Resources*: Verify the app resources that you don't want to protect.

. Select *Define custom application*.

.Result

Astra Control enables management of the app. You can now find it in the *Managed* tab.



//== Rename apps
//If an app has been renamed outside of Astra Control, you can rename it to manage it effectively.

//.Steps
//. From the left navigation bar, select *Applications*.
//. Select *Managed* or *Discovered* as the filter.
//. Select the app.
// From the Actions menu, select *Rename*.
//. Enter the new name.
//. Select *Rename*.

== Unmanage apps

When you no longer want to back up, snapshot, or clone an app, you can stop managing it.

NOTE: If you unmanage an app, any backups or snapshots that were created earlier will be lost.

.Steps

. From the left navigation bar, select *Applications*.
. Select *Managed* as the filter.
. Select the app.
. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column, select *Unmanage*.
. Review the information.
. Type "unmanage" to confirm.
. Select *Yes, Unmanage Application*.

== What about system apps?

Astra Control also discovers the system apps running on a Kubernetes cluster. We don't show you these system apps by default because it's rare that you'd need to back them up.

You can display system apps from the Applications page by selecting the *Show system apps* check box under the Clusters filter in the toolbar.

image:acc_apps_system_apps3.png[A screenshot that shows the Show System Apps option that is available in the Applications page.]

TIP: Astra Control itself is not a standard app; it is a "system app." You should not try to manage Astra Control itself. Astra Control itself isn't shown by default for management.
