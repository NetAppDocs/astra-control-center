= Upgrade Astra Control Center
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

To upgrade Astra Control Center, download the installation bundle from the NetApp Support Site and complete these instructions to upgrade the Astra Control Center components in your environment. You can use this procedure to upgrade Astra Control Center in internet-connected or air-gapped environments.

.What you'll need
* link:../get-started/requirements.html[Before you begin upgrade, ensure your environment still meets the minimum requirements for Astra Control Center deployment].
* Ensure all cluster operators are in a healthy state and available.
+
----
kubectl get clusteroperators
----

* Ensure all API services are in a healthy state and available.
+
----
kubectl get apiservices
----

* Log out of your Astra Control Center.

.About this task
The Astra Control Center upgrade process guides you through the following high-level steps:

* <<Download the Astra Control Center bundle>>
* <<Unpack the bundle and change directory>>
* <<Add the images to your local registry>>
* <<Install the updated Astra Control Center operator>>
* <<Upgrade Astra Control Center>>
* <<Upgrade third-party services (Optional)>>
* <<Verify system status>>
* <<Set up ingress for load balancing>>


IMPORTANT: Do not execute the following command during the entirety of the upgrade process to avoid deleting all Astra Control Center pods: `kubectl delete -f astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`

TIP: Perform upgrades in a maintenance window when schedules, backups, and snapshots are not running.

NOTE: Podman commands can be used in place of Docker commands if you are using Red Hatâ€™s Podman instead of Docker Engine.

== Download the Astra Control Center bundle

. Download the Astra Control Center upgrade bundle (`astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz`) from the https:mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. (Optional) Use the following command to verify the signature of the bundle:
+
----
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify AstraControlCenter-public.pub -signature astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz.sig astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
----

== Unpack the bundle and change directory

. Extract the images:
+
----
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
----

== Add the images to your local registry

. Complete the appropriate step sequence for your container engine: 

// start tabbed block for docker and podman approaches

== Install the updated Astra Control Center operator

. Change the directory:
+
----
cd manifests
----

. Edit the Astra Control Center operator deployment yaml (`astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`) to refer to your local registry and secret.
+
----
vim astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml
----

.. If you use a registry that requires authentication, replace the default line of `imagePullSecrets: []` with the following:
+
----
imagePullSecrets:
- name: <name_of_secret_with_creds_to_local_registry>
----

.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `kube-rbac-proxy` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.
.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `acc-operator-controller-manager` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.

----

. Verify pods are running:
+
----
kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc-operator
----

== Upgrade Astra Control Center

. Edit the Astra Control Center custom resource (CR) (`astra_control_center_min.yaml`) and change the Astra version (`astraVersion` inside of `Spec`) number to the latest:
+
----
kubectl edit acc -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
NOTE: Your registry path must match the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.

. Add the following lines within `additionalValues` inside of `Spec` in the Astra Control Center CR:
+
----
additionalValues:
    nautilus:
      startupProbe:
        periodSeconds: 30
        failureThreshold: 600
----

. Do one of the following:
.. If you don't have your own IngressController or ingress and have been using the Astra Control Center with its Traefik gateway as a LoadBalancer type service and would like to continue with that setup, specify another field `ingressType` (if not already present) and set it to `AccTraefik`.
+
----
ingressType: AccTraefik
----
.. If you want to switch to the default Astra Control Center generic ingress deployment, provide your own IngressController/Ingress setup (with TLS termination, etc.), open up a route to Astra Control Center, and set `ingressType` to `Generic`.
+
----
ingressType: Generic
----
+
TIP: If you omit the field, the process becomes the generic deployment. If you don't want the generic deployment, be sure to add the field.

. (Optional) Verify that the pods terminate and become available again:
+
----
watch kubectl get po -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

. Wait for the Astra status conditions to indicate that the upgrade is complete and ready:
+
----
kubectl get -o yaml -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace] astracontrolcenters.astra.netapp.io astra
----
+
Response:
+
----
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-10-25T18:49:26Z"
    message: Astra is deployed
    reason: Complete
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-10-25T18:49:26Z"
    message: Upgrading succeeded.
    reason: Complete
    status: "False"
    type: Upgrading
----

. Log back in and verify that all managed clusters and apps are still present and protected.
. If the operator did not update the Cert-manager, upgrade third-party services, next.


== Upgrade third-party services (Optional)
The third-party services Traefik and Cert-manager are not upgraded during earlier upgrade steps. You can optionally upgrade them using the procedure described here or retain existing service versions if your system requires it.

* *Traefik*: By default, Astra Control Center manages the lifecycle of the Traefik deployment.  Setting `externalTraefik` to `false` (default) indicates that no external Traefik exists in the system and and Traefik is being installed and managed by Astra Control Center. In this case,  `externalTraefik` is set to `false`.
+
On the other hand, if you have your own Traefik deployment, set `externalTraefik` to `true`. In this case, you maintain the deployment and Astra Control Center will not upgrade the CRDs, unless `shouldUpgrade` is set to `true`.

* *Cert-manager*: By default, Astra Control Center installs the cert-manager (and CRDs) unless you set `externalCertManager` to `true`. Set `shouldUpgrade` to `true` to have Astra Control Center upgrade the CRDs.

Traefik is upgraded if any of the following conditions are met:

* externalTraefik: false
* externalTraefik: true AND shouldUpgrade: true.

.Steps

. Edit the `acc` CR:
+
----
kubectl edit acc -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

. Change the `externalTraefik` field and the `shouldUpgrade` field to either `true` or `false` as needed.
+
----
crds:
    externalTraefik: false
    externalCertManager: false
    shouldUpgrade: false
----





== Verify system status

. Log in to Astra Control Center.
. Verify that all your managed clusters and apps are still present and protected.

== Set up ingress for load balancing

You can set up a Kubernetes ingress object that manages external access to the services, such as load balancing in a cluster.

* Default upgrade uses the generic ingress deployment. In this case, you will also need to set up an ingress controller or ingress resource.

* If you don't want an ingress controller and want to retain what you already have, set `ingressType` to `AccTraefik`.

NOTE: For additional details about the service type of "LoadBalancer" and ingress, see link:../get-started/requirements.html[Requirements].

The steps differ depending on the type of ingress controller you use:

* Nginx ingress controller
* OpenShift ingress controller

.What you'll need

* In the CR spec,
** If `crd.externalTraefik` is present, it should be set to `false` OR
** If `crd.externalTraefik` is `true`, `crd.shouldUpgrade` should also be `true`.

* The required https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers[ingress controller] should already be deployed.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class[ingress class] corresponding to the ingress controller should already be created.
* You are using Kubernetes versions between and including v1.19 and v1.21.

.Steps for Nginx ingress controller

. Use the existing secret `secure-testing-cert` or create a secret of type http://kubernetes.io/tls[`kubernetes.io/tls`] for a TLS private key and certificate in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace as described in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets[TLS secrets].
. Deploy an ingress resource in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace for either a deprecated or a new schema:
.. For a deprecated schema, follow this sample:

+
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: ingress-acc
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: [ACC address]
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
        serviceName: traefik
        servicePort: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
----

.. For a new schema, follow this example:

+
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: netapp-acc-ingress
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
spec:
  ingressClassName: [class name for nginx controller]
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: <ACC address>
    http:
      paths:
        - path:
          backend:
            service:
              name: traefik
              port:
                number: 80
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
----

.Steps for OpenShift ingress controller

. Procure your certificate and get the key, certificate, and CA files ready for use by the OpenShift route.
. Create the OpenShift route:
+
----
oc create route edge --service=traefik
--port=web -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
--insecure-policy=Redirect --hostname=<ACC address>
--cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
----

=== Verify ingress set up

You can verify the ingress set up before you continue.

. Ensure that Traefik has changed to `clusterIP` from Loadbalancer:
+
----
kubectl get service traefik -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

. Verify routes in Traefik:
+
----
Kubectl get ingressroute ingressroutetls -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
-o yaml | grep "Host("
----
+
NOTE: The result should be empty.
