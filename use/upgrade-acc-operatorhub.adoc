[.lead]
If you installed Astra Control Center using its Red Hat-certified operator, you can upgrade Astra Control Center using an updated operator from OperatorHub. Use this procedure to upgrade Astra Control Center from the https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/explore[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog^] or using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

.Before you begin
* *Meet environmental prerequisites*: Before you upgrade, ensure your environment still meets the link:requirements.html[minimum requirements for Astra Control Center deployment].

* *Ensure that you have enabled link:../get-started/requirements.html#astra-control-provisioner[Astra Control Provisioner] with Astra Trident running*
+
. Determine the Astra Trident version you are running:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get tridentversion -n trident
----
+
NOTE: If you are running Astra Trident 23.01 or earlier, use these https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/upgrade-trident.html[instructions^] to upgrade to a more recent version of Astra Trident before upgrading to the Astra Control Provisioner. You can perform a direct upgrade to Astra Control Provisioner 24.02 if your Astra Trident is within a four-release window of version 24.02. For example, you can directly upgrade from Astra Trident 23.04 to Astra Control Provisioner 24.02.

. Verify that Astra Control Provisioner has been link:../get-started/faq.html#running-acp-check[enabled]. Astra Control Provisioner will not work with releases of Astra Control Center earlier than 23.10. Upgrade your Astra Control Provisioner so that it has the same version as the Astra Control Center you are upgrading to access the latest functionality.

* *Ensure healthy cluster operators and API services*: 
** From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all cluster operators are in a healthy state:
+
[source,console]
----
oc get clusteroperators
----

** From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all API services are in a healthy state:
+
[source,console]
----
oc get apiservices
----

* *OpenShift permissions*: You have all necessary permissions and access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to perform the upgrade steps described.
* *(ONTAP SAN driver only) Enable multipath*: If you are using an ONTAP SAN driver, be sure that multipath is enabled on all your Kubernetes clusters.
