[.lead]
If you installed Astra Control Center using its Red Hat-certified operator, you can upgrade Astra Control Center using an updated operator from OperatorHub. Use this procedure to upgrade Astra Control Center from the https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/explore[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog^] or using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

.Before you begin
* *Meet environmental prerequisites*: Before you upgrade, ensure your environment still meets the link:requirements.html[minimum requirements for Astra Control Center deployment].

* *Ensure that you have enabled link:../get-started/requirements.html#astra-control-provisioner[Astra Control Provisioner] with Astra Trident running*
+
. Determine the Astra Trident version you are running:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get tridentversion -n trident
----
+
NOTE: If you are running Astra Trident 23.01 or earlier, use these https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/upgrade-trident.html[instructions^] to upgrade to a more recent version of Astra Trident before upgrading to the Astra Control Provisioner. You can perform a direct upgrade to Astra Control Provisioner 24.02 if your Astra Trident is within a four-release window of version 24.02. For example, you can directly upgrade from Astra Trident 23.04 to Astra Control Provisioner 24.02.

. Verify that Astra Control Provisioner has been link:../get-started/faq.html#running-acp-check[enabled]. Astra Control Provisioner will not work with releases of Astra Control Center earlier than 23.10. Upgrade your Astra Control Provisioner so that it has the same version as the Astra Control Center you are upgrading to access the latest functionality.

* *Ensure healthy cluster operators and API services*: 
** From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all cluster operators are in a healthy state:
+
[source,console]
----
oc get clusteroperators
----

** From your OpenShift cluster, ensure all API services are in a healthy state:
+
[source,console]
----
oc get apiservices
----

* *OpenShift permissions*: You have all necessary permissions and access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to perform the upgrade steps described.
* *(ONTAP SAN driver only) Enable multipath*: If you are using an ONTAP SAN driver, be sure that multipath is enabled on all your Kubernetes clusters.

You should also consider the following:

* *Get access to the NetApp Astra Control image registry*:
+
include::../_include/access-netapp-image-registry.adoc[]

.Steps

* <<Access the operator install page>>
* <<Uninstall the existing operator>>
* <<Install the latest operator>>

== Uninstall the existing operator

. From the *netapp-acc-operator* page, select *Uninstall* to remove your existing operator.
+
image:../use/operatorhub-upgrade-uninstall.png["This image shows the uninstall option from the operator page"]

. Confirm the operation.
+
NOTE: This operation deletes the netapp-acc-operator but preserves the original associated namespace and resources, such as secrets.

== Install the latest operator

. Navigate to the `netapp-acc` operator page again.
. Complete the *Install Operator* page and install the most recent operator:
+
image:../use/operatorhub-upgrade-install-page.png["This image shows the uninstall option from the operator page"]
+
NOTE: The operator will be available in all cluster namespaces.

.. Select the operator's `netapp-acc-operator` namespace (or custom namespace) that remains from the deleted operator's previous installation.
.. Select a manual or automatic approval strategy.
+
NOTE: Manual approval is recommended. You should only have a single operator instance running per cluster.

.. Select *Install*.
+
NOTE: If you selected a manual approval strategy, you'll be prompted to approve the manual install plan for this operator.

. From the console, go to the OperatorHub menu and confirm that the operator installed successfully.

== Upgrade Astra Control Center

. From the Astra Control Center operator tab, select the Astra Control Center that remains from the previous installation and select *Edit AstraControlCenter*.
image:../use/operatorhub-upgrade-yaml-edit.png["This image shows the edit option for the original Astra Control Center"]

. Update the `AstraControlCenter` YAML:
.. Enter the latest Astra Control Center version; for example, 24.02.0-69.
.. In `imageRegistry.name`, update the image registry path as needed:
* If you are using the Astra Control registry option, change the path to `cr.astra.netapp.io`.
* If you configured a local registry, change or retain the local image registry path where you pushed the images in a previous step. 
+
NOTE: Do not enter `http://` or `https://` in the address field.
.. Update the `imageRegistry.secret` as needed.
+
NOTE: The operator uninstall process does not remove existing secrets. You only need to update this field if you create a new secret with a different name from the existing secret.

.. Add the following to your `crds` configuration:
+
[source,console]
----
crds:
  shouldUpgrade: true
----

. Save your changes.
. The UI confirms that the upgrade was successful.
