Managing storage clusters in Astra Control as a storage backend enables you to get linkages between persistent volumes (PVs) and the storage backend as well as additional storage metrics. You can monitor storage capacity and health details, including performance if Astra Control Center is connected to Cloud Insights.

For instructions on how to manage storage backends using the Astra Control API, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/[Astra Automation and API information^].


You can complete the following tasks related to managing a storage backend:

//
//== Add a storage backend

//You can add an already discovered storage backend from either the Dashboard or from the Backends option.

//.Steps from the Dashboard
//. From the Dashboard do one of the following:
//.. From the Dashboard Storage backend section, select *Manage*.
//.. From the Dashboard Resource Summary > Storage backends section, select *Add*.
//. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
//. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
//+
//The backend appears in the list with summary information.

//.Steps from the Backends option

//. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
//. Select *Manage*.
//. Enter the ONTAP admin credentials and select *Review*.
//. Confirm the backend details and select *Manage*.
//+
//The backend appears in the list with summary information.
//. To see details of the storage backend, select it.
//+
//TIP: Persistent volumes used by apps in the managed compute cluster are also displayed.


== View storage backend details
You can view storage backend information from the Dashboard or from the Backends option.

=== View storage backend details from the Dashboard

.Steps
. From the left navigation, select *Dashboard*.
. Review the Storage backend section that shows the state:
+
* *Unhealthy*: The storage is not in an optimal state. This could be due to a latency issue or an app is degraded due to a container issue, for example.
* *All healthy*: The storage has been managed and is in an optimal state.
* *Discovered*: The storage has been discovered, but not managed by Astra Control.

=== View storage backend details from the Backends option

View information about the backend health, capacity, and performance (IOPS throughput and/or latency).

With a connection to Cloud Insights, you can see the volumes that the Kubernetes apps are using, which are stored on a selected storage backend.

.Steps
. In the left navigation area, select *Backends*.
. Select the storage backend.
+
TIP: If you connected to NetApp Cloud Insights, excerpts of data from Cloud Insights appear on the Backends page.

. To go directly to Cloud Insights, select the *Cloud Insights* icon next to the metrics image.


== Unmanage a storage backend

You can unmanage the backend.

.Steps
.	From left navigation, select *Backends*.
. Select the storage backend.
. From the Actions menu, select *Unmanage*.
. Type "unmanage" to confirm the removal.
. Select *Yes, remove storage backend*.
