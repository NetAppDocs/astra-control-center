You can add, remove, and edit users of your Astra Control Center installation using the Astra Control UI. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to manage users.

You can also use LDAP to perform authentication for selected users.

== Use LDAP
LDAP is an industry standard protocol for accessing distributed directory information and a popular choice for enterprise authentication. You can connect Astra Control Center to an LDAP server to perform authentication for selected Astra Control users. At a high level, the configuration involves integrating Astra with LDAP and defining the Astra Control users and groups corresponding to the LDAP definitions. You can use the Astra Control API or web UI to configure LDAP authentication and LDAP users and groups. See the following documentation for more information:

== Manage roles

You can manage roles by adding namespace constraints and restricting user roles to those constraints. This enables you to control access to resources within your organization. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to manage roles.

=== Add a namespace constraint to a role

An Admin or Owner user can add namespace constraints to Member or Viewer roles.

.Steps

//. Make sure that the user has an invitation link:../get-started/register.html[Cloud Central login].
. In the *Manage Your Account* navigation area, select *Account*.
. Select the *Users* tab.
. In the *Actions* column, select the menu button for a user with the Member or Viewer role.
. Select *Edit role*.
. Enable the *Restrict role to constraints* check box.
+
The check box is only available for Member or Viewer roles. You can select a different role from the *Role* drop-down list.
. Select *Add constraint*.
+
You can view the list of available constraints by namespace or by namespace label.
. In the *Constraint type* drop-down list, select either *Kubernetes namespace* or *Kubernetes namespace label* depending on how your namespaces are configured.
. Select one or more namespaces or labels from the list to compose a constraint that restricts roles to those namespaces.
. Select *Confirm*.
+
The *Edit role* page displays the list of constraints you've chosen for this role.
. Select *Confirm*.
+
On the *Account* page, you can view the constraints for any Member or Viewer role in the *Role* column.

NOTE: If you enable constraints for a role and select *Confirm* without adding any constraints, the role is considered to have full restrictions (the role is denied access to any resources that are assigned to namespaces).

//. Make sure that the user has an invitation link:../get-started/register.html[Cloud Central login].
