[.lead]
Astra Control can restore your application from a snapshot or backup. Restoring from an existing snapshot will be faster when restoring the application to the same cluster. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to restore apps.

.About this task

//ASTRACTL-12847/DOC-4147
* *Protect your apps first*: It is strongly recommended to take a snapshot of or back up your application before restoring it. This will enable you to clone from the snapshot or backup in the event that the restore is unsuccessful.
* *Check destination volumes*: If you restore to a different cluster, ensure that the cluster is using the same persistent volume access mode (for example, ReadWriteMany). The restore operation will fail if the destination persistent volume access mode is different.
* *Plan for space needs*: When you perform an in-place restore of an application that uses NetApp ONTAP storage, the space used by the restored app can double. After performing an in-place restore, remove any unwanted snapshots from the restored application to free up storage space.
* *(Openshift clusters only) Add policies*: When you create a project for hosting an app on an OpenShift cluster, the project (or Kubernetes namespace) is assigned a SecurityContext UID. To enable Astra Control Center to protect your app and move the app to another cluster or project in OpenShift, you need to add policies that enable the app to run as any UID. As an example, the following OpenShift CLI commands grant the appropriate policies to a WordPress app.
+
`oc new-project wordpress`
`oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:wordpress`
`oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n wordpress`

* *Helm deployed apps*: Cloning apps deployed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) is fully supported. Apps deployed with Helm 2 are not supported.

[CAUTION]
====
Performing an in-place restore operation on an app that shares resources with another app can have unintended results. Any resources that are shared between the apps are replaced when an in-place restore is performed on one of the apps. For more information, see <<In-place restore complications for an app that shares resources with another app,this example>>.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of an app.
. Select *Data protection*.
. If you want to restore from a snapshot, keep the *Snapshots* icon selected. Otherwise, select the *Backups* icon to restore from a backup.
//+
//image:screenshot-restore-snapshot-or-backup.gif[A screenshot of the Data protection tab where you can view Snapshots or Backups.]
. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the snapshot or backup from which you want to restore, select *Restore*.
//+
//image:screenshot-restore-app.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Restore application."]
. Choose the restore type:
* *Restore to original namespaces*: Use this procedure to restore the app in-place to the original cluster.
.. Select the snapshot to use to restore the app in-place, which reverts the app to an earlier version of itself.
.. Select *Next*.
+
NOTE: If you restore to a namespace that was previously deleted, a new namespace with the same name is created as part of the restore process. Any users that had rights to manage apps in the previously deleted namespace need to manually restore rights to the newly re-created namespace.

* *Restore to new namespaces*: Use this procedure to restore the app to another cluster or with different namespaces from the source.

.. Specify the name for the restored app.
.. Choose the destination cluster for the app you intend to restore.
.. Enter a destination namespace for each source namespace associated with the app.
+
NOTE: Astra Control creates new destination namespaces as part of this restore option. Destination namespaces that you specify must not be already present on the destination cluster.

.. Select *Next*.
.. Select the snapshot to use to restore the app.
.. Select *Next*.
. Select one of the following:
** *Restore all resources*: Restore all resources associated with the original app.
** *Filter resources*: Specify rules to restore a sub-set of the original application resources:
... Choose to include or exclude resources from the restored application.
... Select either *Add include rule* or *Add exclude rule* and configure the rule to filter the correct resources during application restore. You can edit a rule or remove it and create a rule again until the configuration is correct. 
+
NOTE: To learn about configuring include and exclude rules, see <<Filter resources during an app restore>>.

. Select *Next*.
. Review details about the restore action carefully, type "restore" (if prompted), and select *Restore*.

.Result

Astra Control restores the app based on the information that you provided. If you restored the app in-place, the content of existing persistent volumes is replaced with the content of persistent volumes from the restored app.

NOTE: After a data protection operation (clone, backup, or restore) and subsequent persistent volume resize, there is a delay of up to twenty minutes before the new volume size is shown in the web UI. The data protection operation is successful within minutes, and you can use the management software for the storage backend to confirm the change in volume size.

IMPORTANT: Any member user with namespace constraints by namespace name/ID or by namespace labels can clone or restore an app to a new namespace on the same cluster or to any other cluster in their organization's account. However, the same user cannot access the cloned or restored app in the new namespace. After a new namespace is created by a clone or restore operation, the account admin/owner can edit the member user account and update role constraints for the affected user to grant access to the new namespace.

== Filter resources during an app restore

You can add a rule that will include or exclude resources of a specific namespace, group, kind, version and, optionally, label.

Depending on what you select, some existing resources associated with the application could be deleted and replaced by those associated with snapshot. All data on persistent volumes that are part of resource filtering rules will be deleted and recreated. External resources with dependencies on this application might be impacted. You cannot exclude any of the cluster-scoped resources that are automatically included by Astra Control.

.Steps

. Select *Add include rule* or *Add exclude rule*.
. Complete the rule details:
.. Select a namespace for the rule from the drop-down list.
.. (Optional) Enter a resource name.
.. (Optional) *Label selector*: Include a label selector to add to the rule. The label selected is used to filter only those resources matching this label.
.. (Optional) Select *Use GVK (GroupVersionKind) set to filter resources* for additional filtering options.
.. *Group*: From the drop-down list, select the API group of resources. 
.. *Kind*: From the drop-down list, select the name of the object schema. You can add the following `apiVersions` (which are the groups combined with the API version): 
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="1h,2d"]
|===
| Resource kind
| apiVersions (group + version)
| `ClusterRole` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
| `ClusterRoleBinding` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
| `CustomResource` | apiextensions.k8s.io/v1, apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
| `CustomResourceDefinition` | apiextensions.k8s.io/v1, apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
| `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
| `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1

|===

.. *Version*: Enter the API version. 
. Review the rule that is created based on your entries. 
. Select *Add*. 
+
TIP: You can create as many resource include and exclude rules as you want. The rules appear in the Define application Summary. 

== In-place restore complications for an app that shares resources with another app

Performing an in-place restore operation on an app that shares resources with another app can have unintended results. Any resources that are shared between the apps are replaced when an in-place restore is performed on one of the apps. 

The following is an example scenario that creates an undesirable situation when using NetApp SnapMirror replication for a restore:

. You define the application `app1` using the namespace `ns1`.
. You configure a replication relationship for `app1`.
. You define the application `app2` (on the same cluster) using the namespaces `ns1` and `ns2`.
. You configure a replication relationship for `app2`.
. You reverse replication for `app2`. This causes the `app1` app on the source cluster to be deactivated.
