[.lead]
23.10 and later versions of Astra Trident include the option to enable Astra Control Provisioner, which allows licensed Astra users access to advanced storage provisioning and management functionality that is available only to licensed Astra Control users. This extended functionality is provided in addition to the standard Astra Trident CSI-based functionality that Astra Control Provisioner also provides.

The provisioner is not enabled by default in Astra Trident 23.10 but can be enabled using this process.

link:../get-started/requirements.html[Learn more^] about supported Astra Trident versions and other Astra Control Center requirements.

.Before you begin

If you are enabling the Astra Control Provisioner, you need the following:

* Astra Trident 23.10.
+
NOTE: Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/upgrade-trident.html[Astra Trident documentation^] for these procedures.

* An Astra Control license to use Astra Control Provisioner and the functionality it provides.
* Access to one of the following to obtain the bundle containing Astra Control Provisioner:
** The Astra Control Center area of the NetApp Support Site
** The Astra Control Service registry

//Users  need to register on the ACS Registry and create regcred (image pull secret), and then only they can download ACP image either to internal registry or into their cluster.

* An AMD 64 system architecture. The Astra Control Provisioner image is limited to this architecture type.

.Upgrade to Astra Control Provisioner 23.10

. Download and extract Astra Control Provisioner:
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.NetApp Support Site
--

. Download the Astra Control Center bundle (`astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz`) containing Astra Control Provisioner from the the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[Astra Control Center downloads page^].

. Extract the images from the Astra Control Center bundle:
+
[source,console]
----
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
----

. Locate the `trident-acp:v23.10` image.

. Push the image to your local registry

// End collapsible

--
// end NSS tab block

.Astra Control Service image registry
--

. Log into the Astra Control Service registry:
+
NOTE: Docker commands are used in these examples.
+
----
docker login cr.astra.netapp.io -u <account-id> -p <api-token>
----

. Pull the image:
+
----
docker pull cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp/:23.10
----

. Locate the `trident-acp:v23.10` image.

. Push the image to your local registry:
+
----
docker run --rm -v "<my_custom_registry>:/package" cr.astra.netapp.io/trident-acp/:23.10
----
--
// end registry tab block

====
// end overall tabbed block


. Determine if the original installation method used an https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#determine-the-original-installation-method[operator (either manually or with Helm) or `tridentctl`^].
+
IMPORTANT: If you used Helm for the original install and you are upgrading to 23.10, you'll need to use either the Trident operator or tridentctl to perform Astra Control Provisioner enablement. Do not use Helm to enable Astra Control Provisioner.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Astra Trident operator
--
//. Delete the Trident operator that was used to install the current Astra Trident instance. For example, if you are upgrading from Astra Trident 23.07, run the following command:
//+
//----
//kubectl delete -f 23.07/trident-installer/deploy/<bundle-name.yaml> -n trident
//----

. On the cluster that hosts Astra Trident, edit the TridentOrchestrator CR to enable Astra Control Provisioner (`enableACP: true`) and set the registry location for the Astra Control Provisioner image:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: TridentOrchestrator
metadata:
  name: trident
spec:
  debug: true
  namespace: trident
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  windows: false
  *enableACP: true*
  *acpImage: my_custom_registry/trident-acp:v23.10.0*
----

. Apply the changes:
+
----
kubectl -n trident apply -f tridentorchestrator_cr.yaml
----

. Update the Astra Trident configuration so that the new `trident-acp` container is deployed:
+
NOTE: For clusters running Kubernetes 1.24 or earlier, use `bundle_pre_1_25.yaml`. For clusters running Kubernetes 1.25 or later, use `bundle_post_1_25.yaml`.
+
----
kubectl -n trident apply -f trident-installer-23.10.0/deploy/<bundle-name.yaml>
----

. Verify the operator, deployment, and replicasets were created.
+
----
kubectl get all -n <operator-namespace>
----
+
IMPORTANT: There should only be *one instance* of the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. Do not create multiple deployments of the Trident operator.

. Verify the `trident-acp` container is running:
+
----
kubectl get pod -n trident trident-controller-<uuid> -o yaml/json
----
--

.tridentctl
--

. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/upgrade-tridentctl.html[Uninstall Astra Trident from the cluster that hosts it^].
. Install Astra Trident again with Astra Control Provisioner enabled (`--enable-acp=true`):
+
----
./tridentctl -n trident install --enable-acp=true --acp-image=mycustomregistry/trident-acp:v23.10
----

====
// end tabbed block

.Result
After Astra Control Provisioner is installed, the host cluster in the Astra Control Center UI will show an `ACP version` rather than `Trident version` field and current installed version number.
