You can configure several optional settings to enhance your Astra Control Center experience. To monitor and gain insight into your complete infrastructure, create a connection to NetApp Cloud Insights. To collect Kubernetes events from systems monitored by Astra Control Center, add a Fluentd connection.

If the network where you’re running Astra Control Center requires a proxy for connecting to the Internet (to upload support bundles to NetApp Support Site or establish a connection to Cloud Insights), you should configure a proxy server in Astra Control Center.

You can also monitor Astra Data Store storage backend throughput, IOPS, and capacity from the Astra Control Center Storage Backends page. See link:../use/manage-backend.html[Manage storage backends].


== Add a proxy server for connections to Cloud Insight or to NetApp Support Site

If the network where you’re running Astra Control Center requires a proxy for connecting to the Internet (to upload support bundles to NetApp Support Site or establish a connection to Cloud Insights), you should configure a proxy server in Astra Control Center.

IMPORTANT: Astra Control Center does not validate the details you enter for your proxy server. Ensure that you enter the correct values.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Connect* from the drop-down list to add a proxy server.
+

=== Edit proxy server settings

You can edit the proxy server settings.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Edit* from the drop-down list to edit the connection.
. Edit the server details and authentication information.
. Select *Save*.

=== Disable proxy server connection

You can disable the proxy server connection. You will be warned before you disable that potential disruption to other connections might occur.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Disconnect* from the drop-down list to disable the connection.
. In the dialog box that opens, confirm the operation.

== Connect to Cloud Insights

To monitor and gain insight into your complete infrastructure, connect NetApp Cloud Insights with your Astra Control Center instance. Cloud Insights is included in your Astra Control Center license.

Cloud Insights should be accessible from the network that Astra Control Center uses, or indirectly via a proxy server.

When Astra Control Center is connected to Cloud Insights, an Acquisition Unit pod gets created. This pod collects data from the storage backends that are managed by Astra Control Center and pushes it to Cloud Insights. This pod requires 8 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.

Additionally, if you manage Astra Data Store clusters on Astra Control (that is connected to Cloud Insights), an Acquisition Unit pod is created on Astra Data Store for each Astra Data Store cluster and the metrics are sent from Astra Data Store to the paired Cloud Insights system. Each pod requires 8 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores. 

NOTE: After you enable the Cloud Insights connection, you can view throughput information on the *Backends* page as well as connect to Cloud Insights from here after selecting a storage backend. You can also find the information on the *Dashboard* in the Cluster section, and also connect to Cloud Insights from there.

.What you'll need

* An Astra Control Center account with *admin*/*owner* privileges.
* A valid Astra Control Center license.
* A proxy server if the network where you're running Astra Control Center requires a proxy for connecting to the Internet.

TIP: If you are new to Cloud Insights, familiarize yourself with the features and capabilities. See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/index.html[Cloud Insights documentation^].

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Connect* where it shows *Disconnected* in the drop-down list to add the connection.
+
image:ci-connect.png[Shows the Connect option from the drop-down list to enable Cloud Insights connection.]
. Enter the Cloud Insights API tokens and the tenant URL. The tenant URL has the following format, as an example:
+
----
https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com/
----
+
You get the tenant URL when you get the Cloud Insights license. If you do not have the tenant URL, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_cloud_insights_onboarding_1.html[Cloud Insights documentation^].

.. To get the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/API_Overview.html#api-access-tokens[API token^], log in to your Cloud Insights tenant URL.
.. In Cloud Insights, generate both a *Read/Write* and a *Read only* API Access token by clicking *Admin* > *API Access*.
+
image:cloud-insights-api.png[Shows the Cloud Insights API token generation page.]
.. Copy the *Read only* key. You will need to paste it into the Astra Control Center window for enabling the Cloud Insights connection. For the Read API Access Token key permissions, select: Assets, Alerts, Acquisition Unit, and Data Collection.
.. Copy the *Read/Write* key. You will need to paste it into the Astra Control Center *Connect Cloud Insights* window. For the Read/Write API Access Token key permissions, select: Assets, Data Ingestion, Log Ingestion, Acquisition Unit, and Data Collection.
+
NOTE: We recommend that you generate a *Read only* key and a *Read/Write* key, and not use the same key for both purposes. By default, the token expiry period is set to one year. We recommend that you keep the default selection to give the token the maximum duration before it expires. If your token expires, the telemetry will stop.

.. Paste the keys that you copied from Cloud Insights into Astra Control Center.
. Select *Connect*.

IMPORTANT: After you select *Connect,* the status of the connection changes to *Pending* in the *Cloud Insights* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page. It can a few minutes for the connection to be enabled and the status to change to *Connected*.

NOTE: To go back and forth easily between the Astra Control Center and Cloud Insights UIs, ensure that you are logged into both.

=== View data in Cloud Insights

If the connection was successful, the *Cloud Insights* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page indicates that it is connected, and displays the tenant URL. You can visit Cloud Insights to see data being successfully received and displayed.
