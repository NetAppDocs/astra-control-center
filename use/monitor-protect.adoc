== Connect to Cloud Insights

To monitor and gain insight into your complete infrastructure, connect NetApp Cloud Insights with your Astra Control Center instance. Cloud Insights is included in your Astra Control Center license.

Cloud Insights should be accessible from the network that Astra Control Center uses, or indirectly via a proxy server.

When Astra Control Center is connected to Cloud Insights, an Acquisition Unit pod gets created. This pod collects data from the storage backends that are managed by Astra Control Center and pushes it to Cloud Insights. This pod requires 8 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.

NOTE: When Astra Control Center is paired with Cloud Insights, you should not use the *Modify Deployment* option in Cloud Insights.Â 

NOTE: After you enable the Cloud Insights connection, you can view throughput information on the *Backends* page as well as connect to Cloud Insights after selecting a storage backend. You can also find the information on the *Dashboard* in the Cluster section and connect to Cloud Insights from there.

.Before you begin

* An Astra Control Center account with *admin*/*owner* privileges.
* A valid Astra Control Center license.
* A proxy server if the network where you're running Astra Control Center requires a proxy for connecting to the Internet.

TIP: If you are new to Cloud Insights, familiarize yourself with the features and capabilities. Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/index.html[Cloud Insights documentation^].

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Connect* where it shows *Disconnected* in the drop-down list to add the connection.
+
image:ci-connect.png[This image shows the Connect option from the drop-down list to enable Cloud Insights connection.]
. Enter the Cloud Insights API tokens and the tenant URL. The tenant URL has the following format, as an example:
+
----
https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com/
----
+
You get the tenant URL when you get the Cloud Insights license. If you do not have the tenant URL, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_cloud_insights_onboarding_1.html[Cloud Insights documentation^].

.. To get the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/API_Overview.html#api-access-tokens[API token^], log in to your Cloud Insights tenant URL.
.. In Cloud Insights, generate both a *Read/Write* and a *Read only* API Access token by clicking *Admin* > *API Access*.
+
image:cloud-insights-api.png[This image shows the Cloud Insights API token generation page.]
.. Copy the *Read only* key. You will need to paste it into the Astra Control Center window for enabling the Cloud Insights connection. For the Read API Access Token key permissions, select: Assets, Alerts, Acquisition Unit, and Data Collection.
.. Copy the *Read/Write* key. You will need to paste it into the Astra Control Center *Connect Cloud Insights* window. For the Read/Write API Access Token key permissions, select: Data Ingestion, Log Ingestion, Acquisition Unit, and Data Collection.
+
NOTE: We recommend that you generate a *Read only* key and a *Read/Write* key, and not use the same key for both purposes. By default, the token expiry period is set to one year. We recommend that you keep the default selection to give the token the maximum duration before it expires. If your token expires, the telemetry will stop.

.. Paste the keys that you copied from Cloud Insights into Astra Control Center.
. Select *Connect*.

IMPORTANT: After you select *Connect,* the status of the connection changes to *Pending* in the *Cloud Insights* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page. It can a few minutes for the connection to be enabled and the status to change to *Connected*.

NOTE: To go back and forth easily between the Astra Control Center and Cloud Insights UIs, ensure that you are logged into both.

=== View data in Cloud Insights

If the connection was successful, the *Cloud Insights* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page indicates that it is connected, and displays the tenant URL. You can visit Cloud Insights to see data being successfully received and displayed.

image:cloud-insights.png[This image shows the Cloud Insights connection enabled in the Astra Control Center UI.]

If the connection failed for some reason, the status shows *Failed*. You can find the reason for failure under *Notifications* at the top-right side of the UI.

image:cloud-insights-notifications.png[This image shows the error message when Cloud Insights connection fails.]

You can also find the same information under *Account* > *Notifications*.

From Astra Control Center, you can view throughput information on the *Backends* page as well as connect to Cloud Insights from here after selecting a storage backend.

== Connect to Prometheus 

You can monitor Astra Control Center data with Prometheus. You can configure Prometheus to gather metrics from the Kubernetes cluster metrics endpoint, and you can use Prometheus also to visualize the metrics data.

For details about using Prometheus, refer to their documentation at https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/[Getting started with Prometheus].

.What youâll need
Make sure that you have downloaded and installed the Prometheus package on the Astra Control Center cluster or a different cluster that can communicate with the Astra Control Center cluster. 

Follow the instructions in the official documentation to https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/[Install Prometheus].


Prometheus needs to be able to communicate with the Astra Control Center Kubernetes cluster. If Prometheus is not installed on the Astra Control Center cluster, you need to make sure they can communicate with the metrics service running on the Astra Control Center cluster.

=== Configure Prometheus 
Astra Control Center exposes a metrics service on TCP port 9090 in the Kubernetes cluster. You need to configure Prometheus to collect metrics from this service.

.Steps 

. Log into the Prometheus server.
. Add your cluster entry into the `prometheus.yml` file. In the `yml` file, add an entry similar to the following for your cluster in the `scrape_configs section`:
+
----
job_name: '<Add your cluster name here. You can abbreviate. It just needs to be a unique name>'
  metrics_path: /accounts/<replace with your account ID>/metrics
  authorization:
     credentials: <replace with your API token>
  tls_config:
     insecure_skip_verify: true
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['<replace with your astraAddress. If using FQDN, the prometheus server has to be able to resolve it>']
----
+
NOTE: If you set the `tls_config insecure_skip_verify` to `true`, the TLS encryption protocol is not required. 

. Restart the Prometheus service: 
+
----
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
----

=== Access Prometheus
Access the Prometheus URL. 


.Steps

. In a browser, enter the Prometheus URL with port 9090. 

. Verify your connection by selecting *Status* > *Targets*. 

=== View data in Prometheus 

You can use Prometheus to view Astra Control Center data. 

.Steps
. In a browser, enter the Prometheus URL. 
. From the Prometheus menu, select *Graph*. 
. To use the Metrics Explorer, select the icon next to *Execute*.
. Select `scrape_samples_scraped` and select *Execute*. 
. To see sample scraping over time, select *Graph*. 
+
NOTE: If multiple cluster data was collected, each cluster's metrics appear in a different color. 




== Connect to Fluentd

You can send logs (Kubernetes events) from a system monitored by Astra Control Center to your Fluentd endpoint. The Fluentd connection is disabled by default.

image:fluentbit.png[This is a conceptual diagram of event logs going from Astra to Fluentd.]

NOTE: Only the event logs from managed clusters are forwarded to Fluentd.

.Before you begin

* An Astra Control Center account with *admin*/*owner* privileges.
* Astra Control Center installed and running on a Kubernetes cluster.

IMPORTANT: Astra Control Center does not validate the details you enter for your Fluentd server. Ensure that you enter the correct values.

.Steps

. Log in to Astra Control Center using an account with *admin*/*owner* privilege.
. Select *Account* > *Connections*.
. Select *Connect* from the drop-down list where it shows *Disconnected* to add the connection.
+
image:connect-fluentd.png[This image shows the UI screen for enabling connection to Fluentd.]
. Enter the host IP address, the port number, and shared key for your Fluentd server.
. Select *Connect*.

.Result

If the details you entered for your Fluentd server were saved, the *Fluentd* section of the *Account* > *Connections* page indicates that it is connected. Now you can visit the Fluentd server that you connected and view the event logs.

If the connection failed for some reason, the status shows *Failed*. You can find the reason for failure under *Notifications* at the top-right side of the UI.

You can also find the same information under *Account* > *Notifications*.

IMPORTANT: If you are having trouble with log collection, you should log in to your worker node and ensure that your logs are available in `/var/log/containers/`.
