You can invite, add, remove, and edit users of your Astra Control Center installation using the Astra Control UI. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to manage users.

You can also use LDAP to perform authentication for selected users.

== Use LDAP
LDAP is an industry standard protocol for accessing distributed directory information and a popular choice for enterprise authentication. You can connect Astra Control Center to an LDAP server to perform authentication for selected Astra users. At a high level, the configuration involves integrating Astra with LDAP and defining the Astra users and groups corresponding to the LDAP definitions. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/workflows_infra/ldap_prepare.html[LDAP authentication^] for more information.
