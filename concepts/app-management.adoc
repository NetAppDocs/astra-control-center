When Astra Control discovers your clusters, the apps on those clusters are unmanaged until you choose how you want to manage them. A managed application in Astra Control can be any of the following:

* A namespace, including all resources in that namespace

* An individual application deployed within one or more namespaces (helm3 is used in this example)

* A group of resources that are identified by a Kubernetes label within one or more namespaces
