Learn how to deploy Postgres from the https://bitnami.com/stack/postgresql/helm[Bitnami Helm chart^]. After you deploy Postgres on your cluster, you can register the application with Astra Control.

Postgres is a validated app for Astra.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra/learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between a validated app and a standard app in Astra Control Service^].
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/concepts/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between a validated app and a standard app in Astra Control Center^].


These instructions apply to both Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center.


NOTE: Applications deployed from Google Marketplace have not been validated. Some users report issues with discovery and/or backup with Google Marketplace deployments of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL.

== Requirements

* A cluster that has been added to Astra Control.
+
NOTE: For Astra Control Center, you can add the cluster to Astra Control Center first or add the app first.

* Updated versions of Helm (version 3.2+) and Kubectl installed on a local machine with the proper kubeconfig for the cluster

== Install Postgres

Two important notes on this process:

* You must deploy your app after the cluster is added to Astra Control Service, not before. Astra Control Center will accept applications before or after the cluster is added to Astra Control Center.
* You must deploy the Helm chart in a namespace other than the default.

.Steps

. Add the Bitnami chart repo:
+
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
----

. Deploy Postgres with the command:
+
----
helm install <name> --namespace <namespace> --create-namespace -–set global.storageClass=<storage_class>
----
+
NOTE: If the volume size is changed, use Kibibyte (Ki), Mebibyte (Mi) or Gibibyte (Gi) units.

+
You need to define the storage class only in these situations:

*	You are using Astra Control Service and you don’t want to use the default storage class.
*	You are using Astra Control Center and haven’t yet imported the cluster into Astra Control Center. Or, you have imported the cluster, but don't want to use the default storage class.

.Result
This does the following:

* Creates a namespace.
* Deploys Postgres on the namespace.


After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra Control. Astra Control enables you to manage an app at the namespace level or by using a helm label.
