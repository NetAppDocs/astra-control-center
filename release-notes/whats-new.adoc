We're pleased to announce the latest release of Astra Control Center.

== 7 November 2023 (23.10.0)

.New features and support

[[nas-eco-backup-restore]]
* *Backup and restore capabilities for applications with ontap-nas-economy driver-backed storage backends*: Enable backup and restore operations for `ontap-nas-economy` with some link:../use/protect-apps.html#enable-backup-and-restore-for-ontap-nas-economy-operations[simple steps^].

* *Immutable Backups*: Astra Control now supports link:../concepts/data-protection.html#immutable-backups[unalterable, read-only backups^] as an additional security layer against malware and other threats.

* *Introducing Astra Control Provisioner*
+
With the 23.10 release, Astra Control introduces a new software component called Astra Control Provisioner that will be available to all licensed Astra Control users. Astra Control Provisioner provides access to a superset of advanced management and storage provisioning features beyond those that Astra Trident provides. These features are available to all Astra Control customers at no additional cost.

** *Get started with Astra Control Provisioner*
You can link:../use/enable-acp.html[enable Astra Control Provisioner^] if you have installed and configured your environment to use Astra Trident 23.10.

** *Astra Control Provisioner functionality*
+
The following features are available with the Astra Control Provisioner 23.10 release:

*** *Enhanced storage backend security with Kerberos 5 encryption*: You can improve storage security by link:../use-acp/configure-storage-backend-encryption.html[enabling encryption^] for the traffic between your managed cluster and the storage backend. Astra Control Provisioner supports Kerberos 5 encryption over NFSv4.1 connections from Red Hat OpenShift clusters to Azure NetApp Files and on-premise ONTAP volumes

*** *Recover data using a snapshot*: Astra Control Provisioner provides rapid, in-place volume restoration from a snapshot using the `TridentActionSnapshotRestore` (TASR) CR.

*** *SnapMirror enhancements*: Use the app replication feature in environments where Astra Control does not have direct connectivity to an ONTAP cluster or access to ONTAP credentials. This feature allows you to use replication without having to manage a storage backend or its credentials in Astra Control. 
//You can also explicitly trigger SnapMirror updates for a particular snapshot and monitor snapshot destination transfer and protection.

*** *Backup and restore capabilities for applications with `ontap-nas-economy` driver-backed storage backends*: As described <<nas-eco-backup-restore,above>>.

* *Support for managing applications that use NVMe/TCP storage*
Astra Control can now manage applications backed by persistent volumes that are connected using NVMe/TCP.

* *Execution hooks turned off by default*: Beginning with this release, execution hooks functionality can be link:../use/execution-hooks.html#enable-the-execution-hooks-feature[enabled] or disabled for additional security (it is disabled by default). If you have not yet created execution hooks for use with Astra Control, you need to link:../use/execution-hooks.html#enable-the-execution-hooks-feature[enable the execution hooks feature^] to begin creating hooks. If you created execution hooks prior to this release, the execution hooks functionality stays enabled and you can use hooks as you would normally.
